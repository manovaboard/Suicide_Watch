Fox_Trot_above_me,5an7mo,1478050575,Tonight,"I've had one of the roughest days today and I cried so much today basically embarrassing me more than I already have. So tonight seems like the time I should take my life. If anyone cares about my day I'll type it out Well in the morning I had a flashback of when I was mauled by a dog (yes this happened and it left me scarred too this day) then I got too school and someone intentionally spit on me saying ""He stuck his gross McDonalds finger in my face!"" ( I don't even like McDonalds) I was about to roast him into another dimension but I thought whats the point then some else opened a door infront of me and I smashed my face on the door no sorry only laughs then someone tapped on my shoulder I turned around someone started humping me then called me gay (which I'm Bisexual) then everyone started laughing and then I broke down and cried then the voices in my head took over calling me ""worthless"" I just can't get a break any other days either its like this every single day and this is why I want to kill myself. "
idiot-kid,5atn2a,1478132455,I lack effort.,"I don't think that I have what it takes to progress in life, and I'm honestly not sure that I want to. Lately the idea has been coming to me more and more how easy it would be to just stop breathing. I don't want to breath. I don't want to wake up tomorrow. I don't want to go to school or work. I don't want to pursue a career or live as a deadbeat. I don't want to speak or make choices or //do// anything.

I've always been curious about death, and I've not feared it for a long while. On my fifth birthday I realized that everyone has birthdays and birthdays count up, and I knew that old people were around 80, but numbers kept going...I realized everyone, including myself was going to die. I hid in a closet and declared that the numbers would stop counting; that I'd be four years old forever, because I didn't want to die.
I don't remember what I did with the rest of my day, but I know that I must have gotten over it, and in my actual waking memory I have no imminent fear of death. I mean hey, I either find the answer to life's biggest question or I'm not sentient enough to acknowledge my failure. It's really a win-win situation. I don't have anything to fear. The trigger is a second away. The past few months I've done everything to spend my time asleep, because that's what I want to be. Might as well make it permanent. Fulfill my dreams and go to sleep. I don't want to be here."
kuugeki,5e11vi,1479686919,i want to disappear,"for a few years i've been struggling with worsening depression and self hatred. at first i managed to deal with it somehow, distracting myself with different activities, trying to focus on my only passion which is music. recently though, i've been losing interest even in that. life seems hopeless, completely empty. i feel like all i do is hurt everyone around me. i'm a useless person, leeching off others my whole life. i'm afraid to talk about this with my family, because long ago when i tried to open up a bit, all they were saying was that i should go to a therapist. it feels like they've given up on me. 
tonight my only friend told me after three days of silence that it hurts her to see me like this and that's why she distances herself away from me. she said that she can't deal with it and it's hurting her. i told her that i don't want to do that and i'll handle myself on my own from now on, but it hurts so much and i think that i've destroyed our friendship. i've tried to reach out to my girlfriend too, but she took it very lightly. i said i'm feeling very unhappy and that i'm broken inside, but all she said was that i'm going to get better soon. i don't have anyone else to reach out for help to... it feels like i'm completely alone..
i'm currently in college, which i miraculously managed to get into, but i don't feel any satisfaction from it nor any energy to do anything. everything seems so bland and worthless.
i think that everyone would be better off if i was dead. all i do is constantly bring everyone down and hurt them. i want to end it... but i just can't do it for some reason..
what should i do? i don't want to go to a therapist.. i can't talk with other people face to face about my state, not to mention complete strangers.. it'd feel like artificial compassion, that they just want to get their money from doing this instead of helping me.. 
i just can't find any meaning in my life anymore.. it's all falling apart and i just can't do anything to stop it.. i just want to melt into thin air and be gone.. 
can anyone help me?..."
DrSalvation,5czys1,1479175332,Punishment,"I'm wondering how many people that are suicidal are having those thoughts because they do want to die as well as feel like they're punishing everyone. I've noticed with myself a lot of times when I'm feeling suicidal it's because I want people to hurt as I've been hurt. Other times it's like fuck it I don't care, and of course the times where you're like I don't want to hurt anyone. I really hope I'm not the only one who goes back and forth between these and other ones as well. "

balsamic_throwaway,5cc1l4,1478831076,I'm 24 and still a virgin. Give me one reason why I shouldn't end it all.,"I'm so lonely it hurts. I haven't had a girlfriend since my sophomore year of high school, only ever kissed two girls, and took an asexual girl to prom because she was the only person of the opposite sex who I could call my friend. I read a study by the CDC which showed that less than 15% of guys between 20 and 24 are still virgins, and once you hit 25 that percentage takes a nosedive. I'm 6'2"", weigh about 190-200 pounds, and clean shaven, so it's not like I'm not trying to take care of my appearance. In college I was too insecure to ask people out on dates, and when I did try to talk to girls, they just laughed at me. Now I'm out of college and have a full-time job, so I don't know how I'm supposed to find someone. What's the point of living if I have no one to live for? I'm just a parasite on society, unlike my perfect twin brother who has no trouble getting girlfriends. I'll never know what it's like for someone to embrace me, say they love me, and express that love by being physically intimate. I think the last time my birthday brought me any joy was when I was 19 or 20. Instead it's just a painful reminder of how old I'm getting without improving my situation.

I've spent more time than I care to admit fantasizing about taking my own life, and this has been happening for years. Back when I still played League of Legends, I thought about doing a live stream on Twitch for a few hours on the day before Valentine's Day, then blowing my brains out at midnight to give my audience some morbid entertainment. Since yesterday morning I've also considered jumping off the 16th floor balcony of my office building, preferably with someone filming so I can show up on a gore site somewhere. If I can't find validation in life, maybe I can find it in death."

justneededadvice,5b7rn7,1478312215,"For the first time in a while, I'm starting to have urges.","I have always been proud of myself for overcoming my eating disorder and depression and self harm, for rising from my darkest hour. Lately I've mostly had issues with psychosis and PTSD from being raped a year ago, respectively, but it's manageable. I haven't had a serious suicidal thought or urge for years. Until now. I had a miscarriage and nobody cares. My ex-best friend is about to die in combat and we don't talk because my boyfriend hates him, and he went into the infantry because I didn't like him back and now he's determined to die and it's all my fault. I'm falling behind in college somehow. My grades are high but not high enough to maintain this scholarship, which I don't completely need, but I'm terrified of my parents' reaction. I've been getting in so many fights with my significant other of five years lately. We're nineteen and live together. I'm so paranoid of him seeing women naked and watching porn and can't legitimately discuss it because he isn't good at that and can't understand it's likely because I was raped. I love him so much but I feel like he doesn't love me anymore and I don't know who to turn to. We may be breaking up and I know our constant arguments are taking a toll on him too but he moved states to be here and has no relatives here and relies on me for transportation and laundry and food. My life is so full of mayhem and misfortune I can't fully list out all the crazy shit that's happened to me in the past year alone in less than 20 minutes, but... I always thought I was mentally strong again. Now, ending it seems to be the only foreseeable solution to end my stress. He makes me cry, sometimes twice a day. Everything does. I cry and cry and try to be productive but the only thing that seems to help is drugs. I just want drugs. I hate my body, it's not good enough. I have interstitial cystitis and I'm always burning and it's so embarassing and inconvenient for him, I know, because the pain can have me crying on the floor for hours. I always just wanted to be a good girlfriend and wife but now I feel like I can't do anything at all. I feel so stupid. I hate what my life has become. It just doesn't seem worth it to be conscious. I don't know. I just had to put this here, even if nobody listens. 

Edit: further venting. I just found out he had some pictures and whatever else saved of naked women and I suspect he's been watching porn this whole time and it's soul-crushing, especially because no one else would think that's reason to be hurt so profoundly. That's normal for other relationships and that's fine but this wasn't the boundary I thought we had... He calls me a slut or whore for every little thing I do or interaction I have and now he's probably been getting gratification and pleasure from looking at other women sexually for years, even recently as an adult when we've been together for so long and I've basically given him whatever he's wanted no matter how inconvenient it was for me.  This makes me so sick, the thought of him staring at a screen, looking hungrily at someone else. I can't explain how hurt I am. I can't trust him anymore. I'm so alone. I want to die. "
translagnia,5f9ghg,1480303878,I'm not going through with it.,"I'm way too much of a pussy to ever actually do it. I'll just constantly think about it as my health, sanity, and any chance at a good life slowly slip away year after year. Maybe 10 or 20 years down the road, when I'm morbidly obese with no family or significant other and I've finally gone down one too many dead ends… maybe then I just won't care anymore."
Abysmal_EnderLady,5au6qa,1478139025,Living is a burden and I've tried everything to help myself,"I've been depressed all my life. I have tried to kill myself before but the belt wouldn't hold and I didn't cut deep enough. I've done the whole ""Wait for things to get better"" route. Its been 10 years now. Everything got worse and I regret ever waiting.

I've been hospitalized (Twice), I've tried medication, I go on suicide hotlines, chats, forums and help groups. Throughout my whole high school career and beyond I've tried reading about my depression. I know what is wrong with me and how it effects every particle of my life but...it doesn't help.

I graduated 3 years ago. I stopped doing anything three years ago. I didn't go to school or work. I just stayed home to give myself sometime to really think things through. I did everything I could...time isn't enough. It isn't the answer. I don't know what is.

I felt a little better this year and....got a job. I just got it this Monday, on Halloween, and I am working there now.... I don't like it and if anything it is pushing me to edge. It just shows me just how distant I am from being a functioning person. Maybe I'm not a person.

I got worse and...now I just want to end it. I'm also seeing a therapist but she doesn't really help. There is nothing new that anyone can really tell me. I have heard it all.

I did everything I could to help myself and it has been two VERY LONG decades of pain. I just want everything to stop. I want to stop. I don't want to keep going. I don't want a job or a family. I don't want a career. I don't want anything but to be gone.

To not do ""this"". My life anymore. I think its time that I moved on. I just wanted to write it somewhere. Maybe this helps? I don't feel any better. This is the same story I've recalled for years and years for different people and even I get tired of hearing it. 

I want this to be my last year and its going to be."

SweerMortem,5d6xax,1479265328,Pretty much done,"This Friday is final class sign up and drop day at my university. I'm failing a majority of my classes and will likely have to drop a number of them. If I don't keep a certain gpa I'll lose my scholarship. I lack all motivation to continue. Every day it gets harder to get out of bed. Nothing I do is enjoyable anymore. None of my hobbies provide stimulation or solace. I cannot manage to interest myself in any new hobbies. The only nice parts of the week are when I am incredibly drunk. I have no friends anymore. I feel I burden the only two people I actually talk to every time I bring up my depression. It appears I won't be able to sort myself out with school. I don't see any point in continuing but if I were to it would require a college education. If I'm forced out of school I will know the only real option for my life is ended and my life is over.

AkumaKyoushin,5e1yl1,1479699189,The hole just keeps deeper no matter how hard I try,"So roughly 48 hours ago I turned 20 and as with every birthday i took a stock take of my life. So to keep this short here is what is happening:

- My Girlfriend told me she is scared of me and doesn't want to be intimate with me

- My mom is sick to the point she can't work and the medical bills just pile up and we always try keep our head afloat

- I am studying Networking and I'm failing it and consistently lying to my grandfather who is paying for it. Telling him I am doing great. I'm buying time for god knows whatT

- I'm getting fatter because I'm eating to feel happy. I feel like a blob that rolls around disappointing people.

- I haven't got my drivers license so I can't drive my mother around when she needs it because I feel to scared to drive as well as I'm so stressed about college I don't feel I have it in me.

I feel so alone. I don't have anything left in me. I just want to hang myself from the railing by our stairs. I don't want to do that note shit I just want to stop existing. Until that point I just keep dying inside everyday until I get the balls to do what needs to be done. 

Also before I get the ""speak to a a friend"" comment. I haven't had friends in about 5 years. I don't leave my house for months on end. I am truly and utterly alone.

throwaway_____1984,5beis8,1478412777,I feel dumb for even posting this but I can't help it.,"My girlfriend of 4.5 years broke up with me two weeks ago. She said it was because she just didn't think I was the one, and felt guilty being with me knowing that she felt this way and felt it was best if we parted ways. She knows I want to get married and have kids. She does too; just apparently not with me :(

I understand what she means, and honestly I've felt the same at times. The problem is that I'm fucking stubborn and she was an amazing person. She just finished Med school and is now a resident. So even though I had doubts, I felt like she was the best thing that ever happened to me and that I was lucky to have her. Don't get me wrong, I have a great job by any measure and would be considered 'successful', it's just that she was another level past me. I think she thinks of marriage in the Hollywood sense; all romantic and idyllic, and all that bullshit.

After we broke up, the last two weeks have been an absolute blur. I can't even believe it's been two weeks. I've been drunk almost every night, and even still I can't sleep. I get at best 4 hours a night, average probably 2. I feel so hopeless and lost and alone. I can't even believe I've 'functioned' at work. Don't even get me started if I lost my job. I'd be dead within a day.

Reading this, and some of the other posts, makes me feel stupid for feeling so bad, but I can't fucking help it.

She was a beauty. Cute blonde, bubbly personality, everyone loved her. She will find someone else in no time. And that alone makes me feel like ending it. Meanwhile, I'm 32, bald, and short, and starting to get out of shape. How the fuck am I ever supposed to find anyone that measures up to her? Out of desperation I've gone on a couple tinder dates, but they didn't go well. Once they saw me in person I could feel them going cold. Not a good feeling to have when you're already feeling low. I feel like the ship has sailed for me...

But what really got me here tonight, is that I am highly educated with access to some pretty scary stuff that I know how to use to end my life quickly, painlessly, and peacefully. I've already acquired the materials. I've already planned how I'd do it. Pretty simple really. The only thing holding me back is my friends and family. But even that doesn't feel like enough. I don't think they realize the depths of despair that I'm going through. And every time I talk about it I feel guilty and whiny. And I went through something similar 6 years ago. Barely made it through that time... And I felt like a burden on everyone that time...

Fuck this shit. Why is it so easy for everyone else around me? Most of them are married and having kids. I can't help but feel like it's because I'm short and bald; no girl wants to end up with a guy like that. I fucking get it. But goddamnit I can't fucking do a thing about it.

Jesus I read this and feel pathetic. But given my access to the stuff I need to end it makes me scared that I'll just get really down and just go through with it one night when I'm drunk and feeling like shit... maybe I'm not scared. I don't fucking know."

My sister lost her hearing aid and I can't afford to replace it. Her first day of school is in January and she can't communicate properly. She isn't great at signing or lip reading yet, she's only 5. It's not the biggest most catastrophic thing in the world, but watching her struggle without it is really breaking my heart. She was so looking forward to being a big kid and going to school, and now her first months will be an incomprehensible nightmare.

I have bills to pay that I can't pay because the rent was put up. My ADHD and anxiety's through the roof and I can't talk to anyone. Not that I have anyone.

My brother's possibly depressed and has been avoiding me. I think something happened with his girlfriend, she might've wrecked his pride and joy gaming laptop, but he won't say anything.

There's a leak in the bathroom wall. Don't know how to begin to fix it.

I left the rubbish bin open, my dog went in and swallowed a tampon, so he might die.

I might be depressed, or just mired in the reality that everything sucks. Today my sister got so frustrated that she smashed a glass and hit me. My brother didn't even look up or help me clean up, which hurts too.

sudokug,5d3im1,1479228453,Over the past few weeks these thoughts have grown darker,"This post might be incoherent and very fumbly. It's hard enough putting it into words as it is, let alone in a straight narrative that makes sense.

I have occasionally thought about offing myself before over the years, but they were harmless entertainings of the thought, you know. At what point is living no longer worth the bother, and if I went through with it, what are the repercussions for my loved ones? That stuff. I don't want to hurt my dad, who's had a hard life as it is. I don't want my younger brother going through my loss on his own, as it was hard enough on the two of us when we lost our mom to cancer a few years ago.

That's when it all went downhill, fast. I was never a very disciplined student, but I was very gifted. I got through, sometimes barely, on aptitude for the course materials alone. When our mother died, I was 23, and was well over halfway through getting my bachelor's degree.

All of my gusto for the trade (high school education) vanished. All of my gusto for much of anything, really. I managed to grit my teeth through all the raw material and exams that were left to me, but I couldn't be a teacher anymore. My final internship I failed three times. I've gotten even fatter than I was. I often ignore bills until a bailiff order comes.

I'm 25 now, which means no more government grants for education where I live. It also means my dad's taxes would go up since I can no longer be under his care in the government's eyes, no matter my situation. He's been on health care since he had a stroke nearly 20 years ago, so he's not exactly comfortable financially.

I quit my studies with only one semester left. I had to, since all that was left were internships that I obviously cannot fulfill while working. I applied at the store I'd worked at for five years while studying. They were hiring too, but for reasons I still can't understand, the manager I'd known for five years and who had always been content me chose not to hire me.

Me, my brother, and a friend have been renting an apartment for two and a half months now, which is a better financial solution than sending our dad's taxes into the stratosphere. The idea was that I would be working at this store, and we split all the bills three-ways. I was so sure I'd get that job (and so were plenty of my colleagues). But I didn't, so I started applying for other jobs. They either turn me away for being overqualified when they see I went to school for so long, or they send me away for being underqualified when they see I didn't manage to get the degree after all that time. On top of that, it's slim pickings because I don't actually have a driver's license.

I've been applying since the end of August and I still don't have a job. Tensions are rising in this house and I've just stopped... Whatever you call it. I can tell my stance on suicide is changing. Earlier today my brother was yet again telling me how he's getting tired of me still being home. I said it's pissing me off too, that I don't enjoy living off their goodwill and not having a single penny to my name. He started rebutting yet again, and I just had enough. I got up, slammed my door in his face and locked it. Our dad invited us for dinner tonight and I'm not going. I've sat in my room since I locked the door an hour ago now, crying on and off while typing this.

I just want to get my fucking shit together but it feels like the world doesn't let me. And I realize the world doesn't owe me anything, but I don't owe the world anything either. I had to stop myself from googling suicide methods. The very least I can do when checking out is make sure I'm not a grueling mess or that I don't give some poor train driver PTSD.

I don't even know what I expect to get out of typing this. It feels like my life is stuck in a rut, and the only way out is to land a fucking job *soon*. And even then I think I'd still be treating the symptoms and not the cause. I just don't want to anymore man. I just can't be bothered. You try, and try, and try, and you just don't see results.

I just sit here, being a fat blubbering mess, while sending applications into a void that only seems to swallow them. I'm a burden to those around me."

petal4petal,5d8lfb,1479293437,Just struggling with life...,"Let me start with some back ground, I'm a 28 year old male with social phobia, agoraphobia, dysthemia, insomnia, and anxiety/panic disorder and many of these issues started as early as kindergarten, so they are far from new, outside the insomnia which developed right around the start of high school but I have been struggling with them all for a very long time. I've had about 5 years in total of counseling/therapy. I've tried many combinations of medications, none have had positive side effects, but there have been negative side effects. Many therapists either give up on me or tell me things like ""We can only ever expect to make you about 10% better."" and two therapists have suggested I attend a personalized recovery oriented service(s) which I am very afraid of. I'm in a long distance relationship with transgender female who is currently about 5 months into Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT), we've known each other for about 7 years and we've been dating a good amount of them 7 years... we recently met in person in May 2016, which was extremely frightening but she means the world to me, so I managed.  
 
I've attempted a few Jobs in the past that never lasted longer than two weeks because I'd panic before, after and during work and sometimes in the middle of the night between sleep. As you can imagine money is an issue for me. I am living with one of my sisters for free as long as clean, cook, and help with anything else needed around the house. My sister and the rest of my family do not know my girlfriend is transgender and I am not sure how they'd react. I'd very much like to tell them but I am afraid I'd end up homeless. My girlfriend and I would enjoy living together but again money complicates things.. she is currently living with two roommates, and the person officially renting the apartment will not allow me to move in because I ""do not bare my weight financially."" and my girlfriend renting an apartment on her own would be too much of a financial burden for her.  
 
As for her other roommate, she recently moved in which brings me to the next story. My girlfriend around the time she started HRT, reached out to reddit to find someone she can relate with (aka another transgender female) but she didn't tell me about this at all and about a month ago she told me she was on a road trip to pick up her ""friend's friend"" and then stopped talking with me for about a week. When she finally talked with me again, I had to pry the truth out of her. She eventually told me that she's been talking with her for months and she moved her in because she was disowned by her parents. Now, there has been a rift in our relationship. She's spending a lot less time talking with me and I am having issues getting over the fact she lied to me. I am semi-worried that they're having a relationship though I do feel it's very unlikely... and she keeps telling me she just needs time, that HRT has been tiring, trying to be there for her friend, and work have all been overwhelming, which I do understand. 
 
All that said, I am just generally very depressed and often contemplate suicide, I've given up on medical and mental treatment because I feel it's just let me down... add on financial issues, relationship troubles, loneliness, low motivation, the endless fears and strong feeling of worthlessness... I have been thinking about suicide more and more and coming from a situation where my mother committed suicide under a month after I was born and my father has attempted a few times... I really have no idea how to handle life anymore, I don't really have friends and I don't wanna burden my girlfriend and I can't talk with family.. I should clarify I don't feel like I am going to hurt myself but I do know that my mood is dropping and my thoughts of suicide have been progressively picking up... so I am scared I might get there. 
 
I am sorry for the grammar mistakes I am sure there are plenty and I am sorry for babbling.. I am having issues writing this, I don't use social media or write things of this nature... and it's nearly 5:30am here so I am also very tired. Also, I am very shaken up by the idea of even posting here and sounding pathetic but I have no idea where else to turn.. Feel free to ask questions and leave comments, I'm sorry if it takes me a bit to respond, I'll have to struggle with fear of talking with you..."
Doris033,5asm6u,1478121371,Happy birthday to me,"20th birthday, no friends, no one gives a shit. I had my last therapy session yesterday and now I'm all alone, no help, no support. 

I don't know if I have enough pills but enough to do some damage, maybe hospitalise me. But hopefully it will be the end of me. 

I can't see any reason to keep going. I hate life and see no reason to work and sleep just to die anyway. So I just want to go how before I have to suffer any longer

I just want someone to talk to, someone with me for my final evening. I'm sorry "

So here we go:
1. Don't drink. It never works for you anymore, and hasn't for a decade.
2. Take your psychiatric medicines as prescribed, on schedule. This is you not being in denial about the fact you have severe o.c.d. and agoraphobia.
3. Keep your weekly dinner meet up with your friend. Keep your weekly language lesson. These things help tether you at least a little to the real world.
4. Don't email your ex therapist. No matter how much you want to apologize, get support, or somehow make amends. You know it just amounts to stalking, and isn't good for you or her.

Ok, champ, we're having a rough night, but we can do this!"
Alphathrowawayname,5bgn0w,1478450801,[Depressing Title Here],"I feel nothing right now. I sat for 20 minutes thinking of a game to play, a movie to watch, or homework to do. But I didn't feel drawn to any of them. I didn't care. I could stare at a white wall, and I could gain the same satisfaction from doing anything else.

Two days ago I called my campus health center's counseling department. Throughout orientation it was talked about as being a great resource for students who were under the weather. They're booked for the next month. I'm attending a $60k a year top private university, and I cannot get the help I need.

I know I suffer from anxiety. I'm honestly not sure if I'm not mildly autistic. My brain came from nowhere. My parents combined ACT score is lower than mine. It was always a joke that they took the wrong kid home from the hospital. Well, it kind if clicked after I watched The Accountant, the movie about an autistic hitman. It talked a lot about the underlying issues of autism, and quite a few hit close to home. 

I develop quirks easily. I bite the skin around my nails when I'm nervous. I repeat phrases after every sentence when I'm on one of those kicks.

I have sensor overload on occasion. Since I was a child I have never been able to walk down the laundry aisle without holding my breath. Also, I need sound to sleep. Usually I just need to know it's there, but sometimes music or words will repeat without stopping in my head and focusing on a fan's oscillation is my only salvation.

I have always been a creature of habit. I slept in my parents bed until I was nearly 5-6 years old, and after that I wet the bed until I was nearly 13. I always take the same routes to get places, and changes in my routine are often met with staunch resistance.

I have never socialized well. As a child I was violent. I would hit people without reason, and I had few friends. Now I can get by, but I never talk to anyone I know I don't have to. I don't approach new people, and I stick with who I know in a social setting. The only reason I'm even with someone is because she guided me every step of the way.

I can't stop thinking that something is wrong with me. School has me stressed. My schedule is only going to get more busy and difficult as the semesters go by, and the only reason I can afford my tuition is through my scholarships. The type that demand I maintain a 3.0 GPA. Out of my 6 classes this semester, I'm probably pull a B and 5 A's, but I have worked my ass off for each one and that has barely been enough.

Every time I take an exam my stomach turns and flips, and at my worst, I get so flustered I can't concentrate. My head will throb and burn, and I get trapped in a cluttered mind.

I don't know if I can make it another month. I'm starting to hate myself. I'm letting myself go. I'm losing what social skills I developed over the last 2 years of forcing myself out if my shell. I'm gaining weight, becoming lazier, becoming someone I don't want to me. I feel like I'm blowing my one chance. I'm gonna crack. I'm not gonna make it to next month. I just know it."

I was sexually abused for two years, because of that I have panic attacks and convulsions. So I can't drive a car and rely on others for transportation. I can bike to work but rely on uber in the winter. I have chronic anxiety, depression, and autism. Because of all this, I can only work part time. And even that is hardly possible, I call in often sick for my head and body. I've been on over 12 anti depressants. My medication barely helps. Seen three therapists, don't feel better. I'm so sick of relying on others. This past month, I've been having extremely bad pain. I've been to 3 doctors who have no clue what's up. This is all very stressful, as they have to constantly run tests. I'm also without insurance. I've ran away 3 times. Tempted to just be homeless. So, I don't see a way out of these major issues. "

Throwaway17062000,5dcaw6,1479336522,I'm trying a last ditch effort to save my long term relationship and if it fails I'm going to kill myself.,"I also posted this to Off my chest but nobody seems to want to reply.

Throwaway for obvious reasons, I wouldn't want anyone I know finding out about this, I just want someone to hear my voice.

I've been in a long term relationship with someone I love dearly for a while now and unfortunately in recent months things took a turn for the worse, I failed to put as much time into the relationship as I should have done and it resulted in some pretty nasty conflict and some less than loyal things happening.

This girl means everything to me, she's been there for me when I've needed someone the most, she has literally been the biggest part of my life - whenever I see her, I see it as a getaway from my normal everyday shit routine of, wake up, go to work, have no prospects, feel sorry for myself, go to sleep and rinse and repeat.

But when I'm with her everything feels so perfect, it feels like everything is right where it should be and so am I and the thought of loosing that plays on my mind constantly.

I won't let myself loose that and fall into a state of disrepair, she told me she doesn't have the same spark as she used to and while I promised I'd do anything to get it back, she's not convinced as I am.

We've just decided not to talk to each other for a week, as if we were separated, to see what she feels, she still cries at the nightmare of me with another girl, but she just tells me that sometimes she feels things for me and other times she just doesn't.


So I've decided that if she decides that it is well and truly over, I'm going to kill myself.

I struggle with modest autism, nothing that would ever get too much in the way, or that anybody normal would notice without me going out of the way to let them know about it - but my behavior problems plague me and I have trouble setting myself goals that I can keep - anxiety, paranoia and what I think is depression are only a few other things that make me feel horrible about myself sometimes and I can never seem to escape it.

I've heard of people talking how it gets better and from past relationships I would tend to agree, but with this one, I just don't.

I'm convinced she's the one for me, she's out of my league, gorgeous, smart, talented, caring and absolutely loving when she still had more feelings for me - she's everything I could have ever wanted from anyone ever and I simply cannot see myself with anyone else no matter what.

So that's that really, I hope it all turns out okay for me, but if it doesn't then, I'd like to die while I still have a shred of happiness left in my life to remember and not alone and 10 years into the future when I have nobody and nothing good to look back on.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, if anybody has."
bonyua,5csoiv,1479078253,Blah blah whiny,"Okay, so here we go.
Hi, I'm 21 y.o. and my life is kinda shitty. Let's get started.
My life has been not that good since I could remember - my mom loved to beat the shit out of me, my dad is an abusive douche and he still fucks me up daily. But until recently I was a tough girl with stable psyche and had not any suicidal thoughts.

I got raped a year ago by a fof with whom I used to hang out. I was a virgin and he knew it, but fuck it, boys will be boys. My ""friends"" blamed it all on me because reasons. My rapist has got quite talkative and boasted about nailing me. I had to hang out with him because otherwise it would've been suspicious. 

I've had really bad case of PTSD with all those crazy repeating dreams and flashbacks, nausea and, of course, weeping for several hours every day. At the same time I had my finals and diploma. Great, right?

Currently I have nowhere to live, and have to stay at friend's house but I don't know how long I'll be welcome here. I've got no job because nobody wants to hire a grad without any work experience.

My doctor prescribed me antidepressant but it doesn't seem to work as I am still a moping miserable cunt. I see no exit, no escape from this life. Nothing's going to change. I've been through some shit this year and it's getting worse. Everything is pointless.

The only person I still care about is my friend, I don't want to betray her by suicide because she's done so much for me. But I have no strength left to fight.

Oh, and I live in Russia, by the way. That's one big fuckup by definition."

 "
Tommynut,5fmnyz,1480468672,This is a first.,"Hello there. Thanks for being interested in reading this.
  I have been honestly too nervous to voice my troubles on the internet for a very long time about the mental state that I am in, mainly because of the way the internet works now and how people would perceive it, as well as being a total newbie to everything; starting out with nobody who knows me very well. Of course, I really don't want anyone to know me personally, but I'm in a desperate state for help, and I don't know what to do. I found this subreddit and thought I would give it a try since it is so welcoming, (Hell, even though the majority of Reddit would rather watch someone burn in a hole.) but it's worth the shot I guess.
  I'm 14, Freshmen in a brand new highschool. Pretty optimistic most of the time, and I have quite a few friends, (most of them being mainly acquaintances. I am currently unsure if I have any good friends at my school or not.) and I'm pretty concentrated on my work, even though most of my time is spent drawing. I'm making straight A's and B's. From the cover, I guess it's all good.
  -Yet, for the past few years, I've been struggling physically and emotionally. I'm overweight, careless and depressed. Disgusting, deprived of sleep and emotional. The majority of my time is spent in front of a computer, often indulging in some sort of old show or game to get my mind off things.
  The following has been the only cure for my own self pity and problems: ignoring them. I know that it's extremely unhealthy to bottle up emotions and never speak of them again, but there's a reason why I've done this. 
  My mother is my everything to me. She brought me into this world, raised me, helped me and supported me. When it comes to as complicated problems as I have, she somehow isn't this way. I guess it's because her mom was always sort of mean and hateful to her, but it still doesn't make sense. She usually says I need to wake up or get over ""it."" It never helps.
  Two of my good friends at school offer to help me from time to time, but I feel stupid. Downright stupid. I'm looked upon as a freak to the majority of my school mainly because of my likings (which, is absurd! Doug TenNapel for the win.) and attitude, which, is generally quiet. I feel these friends share the same thoughts, even though we are so close, they seem to look a little different at me than anyone else. Maybe it's because I speak before I think. I dunno.
  But in the end, it's too much for me to go talk to these people.
  I've wasted so much time typing this, I havent truly explained my entire problem. Why am I so upset, you may ask?
  I downright despise myself. I've been feeling suicidal ever since I had an injury leading me to stay out of school for 3 months, and I cant stand anything I do. I look at myself as a disgusting slob. -This thought probably comes from my mother since just about everytime I put food in my mouth or a conversation needs to be started, she ends up dissing my weight, which I'm glad she does. I'm glad she doesnt just let me sit and rot, though some word choices of hers are not the best...
  Looking at myself, all I can see is a disgrace. Two chins, dark circles, 194 pounds, an upset mother, and an internet history full of shame. All I have to blame is myself.

  I apologize if this is hard to read. I really pushed myself to write and post this, and I'm currently not feeling well. Hope it's illegible enough. (I'll probably regret posting this sooner or later.)"

SweerMortem,5c63me,1478754124,I'm just not feeling it.,"By rights I should be doing great right? I have a family that cares about me, a Girlfriend that loves me, enough money to go to college and not even have to work a job. I'm tall, fairly athletic, people tell me I'm funny and good looking and intelligent. But I'm just not feeling it anymore. I decided to go to university two states away for what I thought would be a nice change of pace. I wouldn't even be all that alone because my older brother is down here already and hey, I shouldn't have all that much trouble making friends right? But I've ended up all alone. My wonderful girlfriend is two states away as are all of my friends. My relationship with my parents has been tense lately due to various reasons and it doesn't appear to be improving. I'm a decent student but I'm failing 3 out of 4 of my classes pretty much beyond repair, which means i'll only have a single class to show for half a year of my life and a ton of money. It's not even that the workload is overwhelming or the tests are too hard, I just don't have any motivation to succeed. I have anxiety and depression and I'm on my meds. I don't enjoy any of the things I used to do for fun. I've tried going to all my hobbies but all of them come up empty. I have attempted to start new hobbies but I find no interest in them. I have made no friends here in the first semester, most of my classes are lectures and so i don't meet anyone from there and my roommate and the guys on my floor aren't the answer. They're nice guys and all but they aren't very good or intelligent people and all they really do is talk about girls and do drugs. Not that I can judge on the drugs front, I'm currently taking or drinking every substance I can get my hands on because the only time I really enjoy out of the week is when I'm not sober. So yeah, I've failed most of my college classes and my parents aren't happy about it. I don't enjoy anything anymore. Overall I just can't bring myself to care, I know a lot of my problems in life are solvable if I just put in effort, but to what end? I've been wrestling with the idea of killing myself for the past month or two and it only seems more appealing as time goes on. They say wait three days or a week before trying to kill yourself and its been a month. I might actually do it. "

10-28-2016


I have got to the point where I no longer know what it feels like to not feel worthless. Everyday I wake up wishing I had real purpose but feeling to worthless to even know where to start to get it. I feel as if I have no true friends in my life anymore. The closest friend I have is my girlfriend and it has been getting increasingly hard to talk to her. I am starting to feel like she is understanding how truly worthless I am and hating me in the same way I hate myself.


I have been catching myself in this loop where I am endlessly saying “I hate myself” in my inner voice, this has been happening for a few months now and it’s getting harder to stop. I have been working on things around the house to try to feel useful but it doesn’t seem to be helping. 


Lately I have been waiting for the day my girlfriend will leave me. I have been feeling a real disconnect from her for the last couple months. There is a resentfulness toward me that I am having trouble understanding. She has built herself up in a way I could only dream of, she has a great job, a degree, a great gpa, and she is making good, real friends. She worked hard for everything she has yet she looks at me with envy because I “get” to stay home all day. My room feels like a prison and my mind is my cell and I can’t escape. 


I have no real release anymore, weed makes this depression feel like a broken dam were the emotion and worthless feelings pour out for anyone near me to hear and can’t be stopped. Gaming doesn’t help like it once did, I have no interest in programming anymore, and I have no one to talk to about any of this. Drinking might kill me because of this stupid random allergy I developed. Some days I really feel like the quote “drink your problems away” would apply very well for me.

GF has said she feels like she spends all her free time with me in the past but in reality most that time is spent sleeping or unwinding from her work or school which I completely understand and agree that she needs that time but I just wish she would want to involve me in things other than going to the market or mall. 


I miss the days GF and I did things together and where I would actually feel like she wanted me there. I almost have to beg her to let me be apart of her life now. It gives me this almost crippling feeling of sadness that she doesn’t even think to involve me now. The way it used to be is if there was an event going on and her friends asked if she wanted to go, she wouldn’t even hesitate to ask if I could go along. Even when she does allow me to go with her now, after being asked,  it just doesn’t feel the same. I want to know what it feels like to be wanted again, right now I feel like I’m just being tolerated. I don’t feel like she really wants me there. At the same time I can’t blame her. I’m pathetic. I’m just going to have to get used to not really having the same place in her life like I used too.


I can rarely find things to do on the computer that interest me anymore. Maybe all I deserve is this room, forever doing laundry, making the bed, giving the pets food and water and nothing else. 
This depression is pulling me apart. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I want to see a psychiatrist but I need help but I don’t want to inconvenience anyone. That’s a good word for how I feel overall lately. An inconvenience. I want to like life again. I want to have a job. I want GF to respect me. I want to be respectable. I want to not hate myself. I want to feel wanted.


When it comes to GF’s work I just don’t understand why she won’t take time off. Not just for me but for herself. She feels this never ending duty to her job but never feels like her job owes her anything back, like a little leeway when it comes to time off, which they would happily give her if she asked. I know she works for the both of us but it would be nice if she felt the same duty to herself or to me that she feels for her work. Just weeks ago she wanted to quit and even then she was so against asking for a few less hours here and there. It has pretty much became a sin for me to even make the suggestion at times. She won’t even put a little thought behind it. She either completely disregards that she needs the time off or just gets angry at me for asking.




10-30-2016


I’m having a better day today. Last night I got to talk to GF about how I’ve been feeling and she took it pretty well. It felt really nice being able to open up to her and she heard me out, which hasn’t happened in a while. I have to remember that GF has her own everyday battles. She isn’t trying to shut me out, she’s just exhausted and it is hard to hear about another person's issues when you have a week as full as hers. I just let my own insecurities bring me down. I just hope she continues to let me be open with her without it dragging her down into her own depression.




10-31-2016


Today’s another bad day for me. I can’t stop feeling shitty about myself. I layed in bed for the first few hours of the day but I’m trying to keep myself busy and not allow myself to lay back down. I know if I do I will just start feeling even worse than I already do. I usually start feeling better when GF comes home, hopefully today will be the same.


I’m looking forward to going out tonight but at the same time I’m letting my own self esteem and insecurities make me doubt myself. Her friends approval of me means a great deal to me because these are the people she wants to spend her time with and I’m hoping they will want me to come along.
My insecurities are also making me afraid of what GF may have told her friends about me. I still feel like she has been unhappy overall and I still can’t help but feel like I’m part of the reason for that, if that is true then she would probably want an outlet and she also got drunk the other night while out with them so she possibly let things slip. She deserves someone to talk to about me but I just hope it would only be friend of GF and I would hope friend of GF wouldn’t judge me to harshly or share what she says with other people. 


I ended up going and laying back in bed. I was trying not to but I couldn’t help it. I was feeling too shitty and couldn’t find anything I would rather do. Luckily GF texted me a half an hour later which initially cheered me up. Her boss told her to show me a halloween costume of a bloody pad and told me that was going to be my costume and paranoia kicked in and made me wonder if it was intended to be a somewhat hidden jab because of all the texting I was doing the other night. He also told her to tell me I have to choose between that costume or a few beers which again made me think it was a jab at me, it could have been him just messing around but I still think more was said the other night than she doesn’t remember or is choosing not tell me. She forgot that he had asked her to come in early on sunday which makes me think that there is a chance she could have said something about me and forgotten. I know it is probably just my paranoia but I can’t help it, my mind just keeps thinking these things and it affects me.


I just can’t stand feeling this crushing awful feeling that just won’t go away. GF is having a hard time right now and is planning on quitting her class and I feel like I still can’t be here for her in the way I would like to be. I’m not sure if what I’m saying is even helping or not or if I’m saying the right things to her because at the same time I’m just feeling awful. I just hope that I’m not the reason that she is feeling the way she felt today.

8:40 pm


GF decided to quit her class. I’m not sure if she would have came to this decision if I never told her I was this depressed. I was worried that once I told her that I am feeling depressed the same thing that happen in the past would happen again. After telling her last time she also became depressed. We didn’t end up going out with her friends last night because she said she wasn’t feeling up to it so that could be a sign of depression.


I woke up feeling pretty down but pretty much as soon as me and GF left the house I was feeling better. Just getting out of the house for a few minutes and getting to talk and have fun even though all we were doing is going to the market and getting food real fast was exactly what I needed. If only going for walks to get out of the house helped like this than I would be able to help myself feel better but the last time I tried that it didn’t seem to do anything for me. Maybe I’ll try again soon. Anyways back on to point. After GF left for work I was still feeling ok for a while but now I just feel tired and cranky even though I got 7 hours of sleep last night. If it’s not one thing it’s another. 


The only up side to the depression getting worst is that I don’t have much of an appetite and I have been losing weight. When I checked yesterday it looks like I lost at least 5 pounds in the last week. The downside to that is I need to work harder to make sure GF is eating and getting the calories she needs, because I will be thinking about food less.


10:50 pm


I’m feeling a little bit better again atm, not sure why. It’s like a rollercoaster, I guess I probably should start writing the times on these paragraphs I write throughout the day. I’m going to go through the change log and do that for today after I’m finished. 


I really want to transfer these VHS tapes for my mom but I feel like everything is working against me. The wire we spent $80 on is still only showing black and white. I need to try it on my computer but that means I’m going to have to  bring the whole VHS player in my room and find space for it, fun! If that doesn’t work my dad wants to try a cheap wire from best buy which could work but I wish he would just buy it before I return this wire so I know how good it is and know if I should even keep trying on the $80 wire. If all else fails I am just going to have to transfer them all to dvds then rip them onto my computer then finally I will be able to cut unwanted pieces out, doing it this way will add a few long and time consuming steps. After I’m finished I can finally figure out how I want to make them available to family members if the clips involve them in any way.

5:40 am


Last night GF told me I have been holding her back from hanging out with her friends as long as she can remember. I’m making it hard for her to have a relationship with her coworkers because I would like to be included when they go out. I’m making her look like a clingy girlfriend to her friends and that they haven’t included her in things because they knew I would want to be apart of it. I see even more how much of a truly awful person I am. I never thought it was wrong to want to be invited when she goes out. I’m not really sure where I’m suppose to draw the line on things either. When she starts going out more am I supposed to be ok with never being invited to things, because I know that's what will end up happening. I’ve had to ask if I can go to every single thing they have done so far. It’s not like these are only work meetings either. If they are mostly just fun outings why would it be a problem for someone to bring their SO with? She said it even put her in a awkward spot by wanting to go to Knotts scary farm which should be the least awkward thing for her to get me an invite to. Am I supposed to be ok if she makes what happen the other night a regular thing where she drinks too much and needs to stay with a friend? I don’t know if I can ever be ok with that and I don’t know if that is normal or if I’m just a shitty person.
The only examples of good relationships I have are my parents and my parents friends relationships with their SO’s. Every one of those relationships they do everything together and it isn’t a issue and no one is thinking any less of them for it. I just don’t even know what to think anymore. Maybe I’m not deserving of having a relationship at all. 


I have been thinking GF could probably have a much better life without me in it. Maybe it is best if I just start pushing her away. I have been feeling so stuck anyways. What will I do with my life. I’m such a piece of shit. I have no education, no work drive (not sure if that is because of my depression or not), I’m almost 30 and I already have bad teeth that requires more work. I’m just going to be a be a drain on GF’s whole life and I hate myself for that.
If I was to start pushing her away and eventually get to a point where I’m a distant memory to her then maybe I can find a nice way to leave this world without bringing to much pain to her. My biggest fear of killing myself is what it would do to my family, especially GF. She currently blames herself for things where she has no fault at all and I wouldn’t want her to feel responsible for me not wanting to be in this world anymore. 
It is my own fault for being such a big fuck up. I am the one dragging her life down. I am the one who will continue to drag her life down if I stay with her. I just really hate myself for what I have been doing to her.


I’m not sure how long it would take to push her away to a point where she won’t blame herself. One thing that I need to do is move over the VHS tapes to a digital format for my mom so she has something to look back on and see me. I haven’t talked about that being the main reason for wanting to transfer those over because I didn’t want GF to see that suicide has been in my thoughts as much as it has been but I stopped sharing this journal with her account. I just need to be able to write freely in here. 


I used to look forward to things but I feel I no longer have anything to look forward to. TV shows have been my crutch for far too long and they are finally not doing it for me anymore. I used to look forward to the next episode of something (even shitty shows like Arrow) and I was looking forward to the new Star Trek that will be coming out soon but I no longer care if I’m here to see them. I use to look at which of my shows were on what days and watch that as soon as they came on but nothing does it for me anymore. I’m not even able to pay attention to a show the whole time it is on anymore because I just keep hating myself instead.  


I’m not really sure what the best way to go will be. I don’t want there to be a body for my parents to find and I don’t want to ruin any of their property so that takes a lot of options out. I don’t want to use a train because there is too much risk of it leaving me around in even worse shape like it did to aunt’s friend. Maybe if I can find something that would be fast acting that I could take while on a walk or something.
I thought about talking to a psychiatrist but I’m not sure what that can even do for me anymore. Will that bring in a paycheck? Will that help me really get where I need to be in life to be able to provide for GF and myself? What do I even have to offer, I don’t even have a GED? 


It is going to be hard to push GF away. I love her so much and It will hurt every step of the way. Just writing that made me cry for quite a while. This will be difficult but I need to think of how I can do it.

dinosaurs1997,5cxo7l,1479150096,how can i help my sister?,"Hi reddit! first post here. I have a sister who's about 4 years younger than I am (she's 14, we'll call her X) and a couple weeks ago we got a visit from the sheriff saying that her friend (call her L) had called in concern because my sister had sent her a letter saying she was suicidal but would never act on it because she knew how it would affect the family. We take it seriously, and take her to counseling to see if she needs help or just attention. Counselor says everything is perfectly okay. Fast forward a couple days from then, X and mom run into L and her mom at the store. The moms separate and talk privately, where L's mom tells ours that L has tested positively for sociopathic tendencies, and has already talked one girl into hurting herself pretty badly. Of course, we tell X to stop contacting L and she seemingly does.

**Present day: I am at school when this happens, so i get a vague watered-down version of what happened.**

4 cops come to our house in the middle of the day, and are apparently really big. My sister is very small for her age (~80 pounds, just under 5 feet), and is in my room on the computer. They walk in, one goes to my mom, another to my dad, and 2 go into my room to talk to her. Apparently, someone had submitted a letter/form on sunday to the National Suicide Hotline with her information on it, saying that she had stood over our mom with a knife while she was sleeping. They came to the house on Wednesday. Now, me and X have always liked scary movies/shows (criminal minds, dexter, etc) but she has never ever displayed any tendencies like this. The cops go through the computer history and don't find anything. They admit that it doesn't make sense for there to be a form to send to the hotline and that they got a call from them (Supposedly). Today we get a call saying it came from our computer. None of us can get her to admit or say anything other than ""no i'm fine i wouldn't do that"". it's very frustrating and scary and i have no idea how to help. We are really close but I don't know if she's being framed by L or if she's doing it for attention.

**EDIT:** We found out today from X's school principal that L was the one who had written the letter. Again, i was at school while my parents went to the school to meet with him and i know very little details. None of us are sure how we found out or if the police know, but I am very happy that it's over :)"

rockymountainraga,5armys,1478111512,it makes sense,"lol this is dumb I don't know why I'm bothering to write this.

I am very lonely. I've never really felt loved by anyone, including my parents and sister. My mother died when I was young and my stepmother has never really liked me (for good reason). I've only ever had two close friends and one of them ghosted me after being best friends for seven years, and the other one goes to college on the other side of the country and we only ever exchange one or two sentences at most over skype text chat every couple of days. I can sort of deal with not having any friends though. What I really want is a a girlfriend (how pathetic!). As far as I know no girl has ever been interested in me. I've never had a girlfriend, let alone been on a date. And I've finally accepted now that I am completely unlovable. I have _known_ this for awhile now, but it is only recently that I have actually accepted it. I make the distinction because I think there is a major difference between knowing something is true and accepting that something is true.
I fantasize constantly about being in a relationship. Hugging, cuddling, kissing, all that lovey dovey jazz. Even the boring stuff, like going grocery shopping together, or her dragging me off to something I don't really want to do but I do anyway because it makes her happy. Sometimes I even fantasize about having an abusive girlfriend, one that hits me and tells me to kill myself, because if she does that than that means she feels *something* towards me. I would really love nothing more than for a girl to hug me and tell me she loves me. But that's never going to happen. I just want to be loved by someone. Is that really so much to ask? Yes, trust me, I think that this is just as pathetic and cringeworthy as you do. But I can't shake the feeling no matter how hard I try. I've tried getting hobbies and some of them I really enjoyed but none of them made the loneliness go away. There always feels like there's this big love-shaped hole in my heart that nothing but the love of another person can fill. I don't like being like this. I really wish I could be happy by my self, or at the very least, not be such a horrible, annoying, absolutely completely utterly unlovable person. Which leads me to my conclusion. 
Thinking rationally, committing suicide and finding love would have the same effect: ending my loneliness. If I were to be loved, I wouldn't be lonely anymore. If I am dead, I won't feel anything. And the best part is that death is permanent. Love can fade over time, partners can cheat on you, etc but death is permanent, unceasing, unchanging peace. "
mango4927,5as606,1478116791,I have a controlling mother who forced me to graduate from high school. I feel stuck,"I had a healthy relationship with my girlfriend until my mother felt jealous that she was getting all the attention. My mom then went on to try and ruin my relationship with her. Well it fucking worked because I haven't seen or talked to my gf in 3 months. My mom's sister was diagnosed with cancer and since then my mom has completely controlled my life even more than before.

My school suggested that I graduate early in my senior year, allowing me to tart university one semester early. My mom told my principal to go ahead without even asking my permission. So now I haven't met any of my friends from high school in months, my mom yells at me and is almost bipolar for every ""mistake"" I make. Even if I wanted to contact my old friends I'm too scared that my mom will find out. My dad is understanding. I happened to run into my old friend and instead of stick around and hover over my conversation with him, he told me to take my time and come to the car when I was ready.

My dad is great. He is always supportive. Was always supportive of my relationship and was even fond of my girlfriend. My mom even tried to feed him lies about her but I don't think he budged. I start university in January, but wont be 18 for another 7 months. Thinking about moving out at 18. But I feel stuck. 

I'm having physiological issues. Sleep doesn't come easy. I used to be a great writer but I can tell as I write this that my thoughts are all over the place. I don't even know if someone will be willing to read all of this. I can't even get a hard on sometimes, no matter how hard I try. My body feels frail. I started working out lately and it's somewhat helping. I don't feel true happiness unless I'm around my close cousin. He's pretty much the only ""friend"" I've got right now. He's just oblivious to my situation.

I'm even using incognito right now on my laptop in case my mom snoops. She's always been a snooper. In fact to this day, my mom gets all my emails forwarded into her inbox. 

I guess I just don't know how to bring it up with my dad. He's a great guy, and I was never really close to him, but in recent months that's changed. We're almost best buds.

I'm essentially stuck at home all day with nothing to do, one cousin to text when he's not at class, and every sports game to watch. The only social experience I have is playing cricket every Friday night with this certain group of guys. 

I'd appreciate any help I can get. Maybe I just needed to get all of this out. I dont know. thank you guys in advance."

I was good at school, but I am girl in a religious Islamic family. I was told I would never have a career. I felt devastated. I was forced to put the veil on when I was nine.

I changed my career and became a teacher, saved up so much to be able to get married, but right before marriage I realized that I am entering marriage for all the wrong reasons, and that I was giving up my freedom. My parents did not agree, I did not speak loud enough, or insist. I am pathologically fearful of being alone. I have lived with depression all my life. I have been an atheist since I was 14, my parents gave me exorcisms for my unholy thoughts. Anyways, now much later in life. I am 27, been married for 3 years. I quit my job last year. Had a nervous break down. Acted too weird, my parents put me in a mental hospital where I was violated and given ECTs. I have not done anything at all in two weeks. I feel like life is completely pointless. I have been wanting to die, ever since I could remember, but after being sent to this hospital after all these years trying to pretend to be like other people. well that just popped my bubble. How can I live if I feel I am not a person. I look forward to nothing. After that ECT, I have not been able to concentrate and I constantly feel foggy. I feel there is no hope. I have tried and now I am done. I feel nothing. My mind was raped. I do not want to get a job, wash the dishes, do laundry, take proper care of my cat, smile, make food... All the above feels like too much work. I feel like I have been in a trance state for the past two weeks. I feel like I could never express myself properly. After the hospital, I have lost all myself esteem. I have not been able to leave the house because I feel too ugly."

FollowerofJesus1,5fm2le,1480461893,I hate being black!,"I hate being a black male!
No matter what I do I will always be viewed as a monster who will be unsuccessful. The statistics show that most rapists are black. And most people in jails are black. Why even bother living?  I turn on the news and see black youths, unarmed being shot. I wear a suit and or argyle sweaters and khakis so I don't look like a gangster. I just look like the Christian I am. When I walk past women they clench their purses. I get good grades but I read that a white man with a criminal record has a higher job opportunity than a black man without a criminal record. People often complain about welfare, something that I found not use. People also assume that if you are black with a high position people will assume that you have your job because of affirmative action which usually helps Caucasian women 90% of the time. (Exageration) I will never be able to marry a beautiful wife. Why even bother living? The Blacks around me do not appreciate me, they think that I think that I am better because of my education. Growing up in school I went through years of being called an African refugee and kuntakente. What I meant by not marrying a beautiful wife is my own personal preference. From a very youngage I found blonde hair blue eyed women attractive. Unfortunately I could never feel accepted by a blonde hair blue eyed white woman. I simply am not good enough.

[deleted],5bwts3,1478648109,I can't stand being in my own body after what I've done," I'm 14, in high school (well, not really), and I just want to die. I'm currently receiving 'treatment' for anorexia, I'm not allowed in school and I can't fucking stand it, but not nearly as much as I can't fucking stand my body and my mind. 
 I've had a longtime crush on a girl, named Ellie - the sweetest, happiest, most beautiful, most full of life embodiment of pure perfection you'll ever meet - and I've wronged her so deeply. About a year ago, when I first developed feelings for her, they were purely sexual, and I voiced that to my friends. I know now that this is completely inappropriate, and I never should have done this. This alone is not particularly bad, but it's the fact that one of my friends told her, and even after she asked me to stop, I continued.
 I made her feel so uncomfortable that she told a friend of mine that she felt physically sickened to even look at me, but I lacked the empathy - the human emotion - to feel sorry for her, and instead felt sorry for only myself because of the fact that she would no longer speak to me - or if she would - she was unbelievably mean to me.
 10 months passes and it's the next academic year, and I'm still obsessed with her. I'm talking to a friend of mine across the table about Ellie, and I say, 'Hey, if Ellie ever asks you to hold her sweater or something, could you send it my way so I can smell it?'. Creepy as hell - disgusting, I know. Anyway, he tells a girl, named Jess, what I've said, and she says to me that she's going to tell Ellie. I then pull out a razor blade and say, 'If you do that, I'll cut myself'. 
 This girl, however, get's the wrong idea, and thinks I'm threatening her. She and Ellie both tell a police officer what's happened, and I get removed from any classes with Ellie, and have to sit on the other side of the room to Jess.
 I can't believe I made these two girls feel that uncomfortable to be around me, and that Jess and Ellie both felt UNSAFE around me. I'll never forgive myself for what I've done.
 I never meant to hurt either of them, and I would never even dream of it, but I have, and I deserve to die for it. 
 I'm just so depressed about this and the fact that Ellie won't even speak to me anymore, I don't know what to do other than to end my own life.

 Peace,
 Love,
 Empathy,

""He's so fat, hahaha"" is a common reaction to my appearance even after I lost a significant amount of weight. I give up.","I hate my family. I hate my brain. I hate my mind. I hate my ugly face and my ugly body. I hate my shallow society. I hate that nobody cares until violence occurs. I got bullied mercilessly throughout school to the point where I gave up and dropped out because snitching did nothing. I understand that I have acne, fat, a crooked nose, bad teeth, ears that stick out, my lips and fingers look weird, I have a lazy eye, I'm flawed in just about every possible way. Mental illness runs in my family. I have dandruff because my dad used to make me wear his hats and he had dandruff. I see people laugh as they walk past me. I see people smirk at me then look at their friends and make low-effort jokes about my appearance. I snitch and people deny everything and I get told the generic phrases such as ""maybe she wasn't laughing at you maybe she was flirting with you,"" or ""why do you care what they think of you,"" or ""just ignore them and they'll stop bullying you,"" or ""he's just jealous of you,"" and so on and so forth. I understand that people think that suicide isn't the right option or that it's illegal or that it'll hurt my acquaintances. My family hurts me by constantly denying the emotional support I need. About half a decade ago, my dad told me that I should commit suicide so I doubt he'd care if I died. I could complain for hours about the things my family does. I try to talk to people and they misinterpret me so I guess this will be severely misinterpreted too, but I'm so tired of my mental problems and my health problems. I strongly disagree with a number of sayings that people tell me when I seek help. ""Tomorrow is a second chance,"" yeah sure everyone just conveniently forgets that stupid thing you did that one time, I doubt that. I don't know if I'm shooting myself in the foot by writing this, but I need to vent and I'm unable to complain to my acquaintances because I never have all the evidence they request. Apparently, in order to prove that I got made fun of, I need a name, face, time stamp, and video/audio footage of the incident. If the bullying isn't loud and clear, then people don't believe that it ever happened."
mojo--,5f8iqi,1480292154,Morning Plans,"Today I've decided to die. 
I'm looking for ways to fill 
this empty 
Heart of mine. 

Maybe I'll fill it with soil 
From the ground, 
Or maybe some saltwater 
From the sea. 

Today I've decided to stay,
and watch the inevitable 
sun to cast its rays 
To people who still 
Find it beautiful. 

I do not know what 
it meant; 
I do not know what 
Am I to anybody. 

Today I've decided to die. 
The last stream of tears gave 
relief to my brittle bones,
All vigor and juice gone,
all but that desire. 

I want to see myself 
in another light. 
When I love, love would
Love me back. 

That love would embrace 
me in all my tired brain 
And confessions, of 
How much I could 
Surrender to a soul
I give my heart to. 

But the world said I
Am weak, and to it,
now,
I believe. 
All those reels I made,
The poems I've written,
All of them
are nothing now.
My muse can't save me,
Not this time. 

so, today, 
I've decided to die. 
And how I wish I could 
Still save myself. 
How I wish i could still 
See day. 

I'm sorry. 


...all I want is a hug right now. Thank you overwatch for trying to fill that void, but I guess, even my beloved game can't save me. I love you all. Thank you"
throwaway_2372187,5ant4g,1478057993,I don't know what to do with myself,"I am a 16 year old male from the US and have not been formally diagnosed with depression but all the symptoms are there. I don't know what to do with myself because I hate myself so much. I learned today that I'm failing a class in school even though I am trying to learn the content and it makes me feel worthless. My school work in general has been declining recently because when I get home, I either just end up falling asleep or I keep thinking of all the terrible things I've done and how I should die. I'm sorry if this becomes a list but I really need to get these things out. 

I know this part may make me sound like an even more disgusting person but I feel like because I am not straight and nobody has ever expressed anything resembling attraction towards me. I feel like I can't have a relationship because I'm unlovable and I'd only burden the other person down. I am extremely insecure about my sexuality because I can only get off under certain (unconventional) conditions. This especially makes me feel like a broken person. The only thing that would ever make me truly happy in life would be raising an exotic pet, but I will never be successful enough to have the money to support it and, knowing myself, I'll probably be too incompetent to take care of it. It makes me feel like I'll never find true happiness.

I am impulsive and I can't control my actions. I'll say and do bad things and not feel sorry for them afterward for about an hour. It's like there's this emotional high where all the blood rushes to my head and I start to act very immaturely. This has directly affected everyone around me and, in the past, has driven several people to self-harm. This is perhaps the hardest thing to deal with considering I have to deal with the weight of this daily and I STILL cannot control my behavior for my own sake. Although I don't act exactly the same way I did back then, I am still very impulsive when I'm around a large group of people that don't make me feel like garbage. I even annoyed one of my friends to the point of not wanting to talk to me anymore today because of my impulsive behavior. All of my friends don't talk to me outside of school. They probably just talk to me out of pity because I have no one else. They'd be better off without me. I have nobody who really cares. 

At school, I just feel dead if I'm not having the weird rush. Every day feels the same. I walk down the same halls, learn from the same teachers with the same learning styles, do tons of work, go home, do more work, sleep for 2-5 hours, and come right back to school. It feels like an endless cycle that will never end. I don't want to be there, but this is what my life will be like until I retire. That doesn't define success for me because it will never make me happy. Money means nothing to me anymore.

My parents are very religious. I am not. I feel like they only love one side of me and they would be disgusted by the other side. I am in fear of how they will respond to who I actually am when I decide to stop living a lie. I am afraid to tell them I may be depressed because I guarantee 100% they'll start sending me to church more and force religion down my throat. It is especially painful because my church is so homophobic.

I am terrible in school. Even though I take all AP (college-level) courses in high school, I cannot ever master the content because I am easily distracted in class and cannot learn things by ear. Everybody does better than me. My grades are faltering. Trying at this point feels fruitless because I always turn out with c's and d's now no matter how hard I study. It makes me not want to go to college or get a job because the amount of work has begun to take a toll on me but I still cannot manage to do a single fucking thing right. Any contribution I make will be pointless because someone else can do it better. 

I've been researching lots of suicide methods recently. I don't know which one I want and how to do it still but I am heavily considering it at this point. I honestly don't see why I shouldn't at this point. I just want out soon. I don't know what to do with myself.
Also, for anyone that actually reads this, I'm sorry for being such a terrible writer"
Bad_Mojo_Monkey,5f8v36,1480296309,I don't know what I can do any more and I don't think I can stick it out much longer.,"Okay so here's the thing, I have struggled with depression and anxiety and all of the things that can come from the both of them all my life.

 I thought that I was finally Getting somewhere for a while. I at the time was with someone that I thought I would be with my whole life and they left me and want nothing to do with me. I have lost several people to suicide in the past few years. I had so much stress and anxiety I couldn't hold my job or even live by myself anymore. I lost everything I had worked so hard for in a matter of a couple of months.

I'm not saying I am the worst of person in the world. I have family and friends who are trying to help me out and who do genuinely care about me.

However I have been getting professional help and trying everything and do everything I am being told to do to try and feel better but I just can't.

Every second to me is torture. I can't enjoy anything. I don't have anything to work towards any more. I don't have anything I want to accomplish. I don't have anything. I have completely and utterly lost the will to live.

I truly don't believe that there is anything anyone can do or say that will help at this point.  People have tried to do everything they can for me and I have tried to help myself.

I just feel like I am broken beyond repaid and a lost cause.

I don't think I can go on like this much longer."

I am incredibly bored and dissatisfied with my life. Im 16 and in a horrible place, mentally. Everytime I think about it, I make myself out to be an idiot, but I can't ignore the feeling anymore. 
On paper, I probably seem like a pretty decent person. B+ average in honors classes, cohead of a few clubs, very extroverted, amazing girlfriend, and from a relatively well-off family. Despite all of this, I manage to make myself feel worthless. I'm extremely hypercritical of myself, and I'm extremely paranoid as a result of never satisfying my parent's desire to be the absolute best. Every time my girlfriend does anything to suggest in the slightest that she isn't 'madly in love' with me, I feel insecure and want to break up. It's stupid, and I don't deserve her. After moving schools, I feel like my personality netted me a lot of friends, but not a single one can break the surface and talk about anything real. I feel like I'm becoming this fake person with a plastered-on smile. In complete honesty, I haven't genuinely laughed in 5 months, although it's a pretty common sight to see me chuckling with a group of people. I haven't contributed anything to anyone. I've just been sucking resources from my family, and done nothing to reciprocate at all. For someone who is depressed, I do believe I am extremely rational. That's the only thing keeping me from killing myself. It's knowing that people might be affected, and temporarily scarred that someone they were so 'close' to was actually considering shooting their brains out for months on end. My family life is dull. After leaving the numbskulls at school, I'm taken back to a household devoid of love and a feeling of anything. I hate being at home. I hate being at school. I hate associating myself with people who have never had a real conversation in their lives, and I hate how ignorant I'm becoming because of it. I hate that I'm jealous of my girlfriend, the sweetest, most intelligent, pure creature on this side of the world. I just hate the hole in my life, and that I'm not up to my own depressing expectations. I hate my faltering grip on school, and seeing my future pass me by. I simply hate myself. I'm literally bored to death and I hate every second of my existence. There's so much more to it that I'm listing, but it's over now, and there's no point crying over spilt milk. In the same way, I don't think anyone's going to cry over me."

Notathrowawayiswair,5ef3lf,1479871009,I tried again today and the gun misfired again.,"The first time was two years ago with an old Polish service pistol that in all fairness had a firing pin that was going bad, but it's the same gun my brother stole from me and shot himself with a couple months ago.

The second time was the day before yesterday with a new gun I just bought to replace the one my brother used because the state I live in destroys all guns used in a crime or something like that. I've put approximately 1500 rounds through it and this is the first time it happened.

I don't believe in some sort of higher power or anything, I am just slightly amused by the strange coincidence.

Anyway, I've lost a majority of my immediate family in less than twelve months. As a result I'm responsible for all of my families debts so we don't lose the house and I'm honestly not doing the best job of it. I have a hard time getting out of bed in the morning and I'm watching this business I've inherited crumble around me.

The funny thing is I honestly don't care.

Y'all probably wont believe me but w/e.

I'll probably try again soon. Third try is the charm right?

Edit:

So, I just broke up with my very long term girlfriend of several years a few minutes ago. Or she broke up with me, you know, whatever.

I figure my biggest problem has been a lack of planning and location.

I figure I will head out into the woods and give the cops a call before hand. My biggest recent fear has been family finding me.

It wont fail a third time.

candyfossil,5dyrzc,1479659685,From monkey to koala. I'm sorry.,"This might be goodbye.

I have no reason to live. I don't have enough money for rent, let alone my medical bills. I'm starting to believe I'm not cut out for my dream career. I don't want to believe that I lost the love of my life. Did you read the messages/letter from Friday night?

For the first time it feels like I'm wearing the promise ring from a dead man. I feel sick. I can't eat. I can't sleep. Trust me, I've tried. I've been wearing your shirt again to feel you encompassing me.

I don't want my parents to know what happened this year. I rather they have a pleasant last memory of me. I don't want them to see this either. I'll write a letter and mail it to them, and tell them our star-crossed lovers' story. I know how they will best understand the news. Do not interfere with my parents.

I've tried to come up with countless scenarios of what you do during your extended silences, trying to believe in all that is good. My koala wouldn't hurt me, even though I've hurt him in ways no one could've imagined. Koala is a great person, a model human for our future children. Koala couldn't possibly be discovering the hidden gems and delicious foods of our hometown without me. Koala has classes to focus on anyway and needs to save money. But then I began to question my beliefs after you said you continue to see her. I didn't notice there were two rocks in the photo you sent me. Did you go there with her? Please don't take her to Aroma, Via Cibo, and Maha's, that is my dying wish.

I wanted you to call last night so I could hear two things from you. 1) that you love me and 2) that our chapter isn't over. You are the reason I want to live. I couldn't fall back asleep last night after waking up within 3 hours of falling asleep. I puked last night. I puked again this morning on my bed, and then in the bathroom sink when I realized there was more. It was just yellow vile liquid, my stomach is empty.

Without you by my side, I want to run away from this life. You, the person who asked me to marry you, albeit lightheartedly, were the only person I cared for and loved so intensely. Maybe I should start a new life as a nomad. But I don't have any money. Each life ends with the same result. So what if it's early? I have nothing to look forward to. I imagined our future as the only future. We supported each other through all the rough times. I knew even if my dream career wasn't attainable, you would support my plan B, C and all the way to Z. I met you when you were a freight member at HD, and I didn't walk away. I let other people's thoughts cloud my own, and I shouldn't have. They don't know you the way i know you. I love you.

I'll wear the rings as always, and the shirt you wore on our first date, it only seems fitting for the end. Full circle.

I will love you until my last breath. We'll recreate the moment we met in heaven. I'll be waiting.

Goodbye"
BK7s,5f40qx,1480227554,I don't know what's wrong with me.,"Hey all, I've been feeling really odd for a while now and I just can't keep lying to people, I need to tell someone. For the past year and a half, I've been becoming increasingly discontent with my life. 

I have everything. Decent grades, a serious place in my future career and contacts to boot, a good college lined up, and a great girlfriend. But still, I feel horrible. My line of work involves being creative, something which really used to make me feel alive, but now I get nothing from it. No enjoyment, no sense of fulfillment, nothing. 

I have interactions with family, and act cheerful and happy. It's so easy for me to act this way, but it's nothing but a mask. I feel none of the emotions I put into the interaction. I go on dates with my girlfriend, have a great time, but then feel awful afterwards. I contemplate whether I'm faking myself for her sake or not, and I honestly can't even tell the difference anymore.

My life holds no emotion anymore, I can't feel anything at all and it's horrible. I don't know why the hell I'm like this but it's making everything meaningless for me and I'm afraid of spiraling out of control. I'm not suicidal I just don't know what I'm doing anymore."

Every year the memories haunt me in the worst way. I second guess everything I've done.

I'm so very close to giving up. I'm so unstable it isn't funny, I've spent so much time contemplating why. I hit suicidal every day. Between the bipolar and bpd its never going to stop it seems so hopeless. I'm always going to end up back here I can never win. I've started cutting again and drinking along with binge eating.

I just cant handle this anymore."
1817161514,5esq6d,1480064988,"recovering from homelessness, i didnt know i could feel this alone","I'll try to keep this short. Two years ago I was kicked out of my mom's house. My step-dad committed suicide and it caused her to start drinking again, which caused us to fight a lot. I was raised by my dad and he never let me or my siblings have any contact with her, so when I met her and moved into her house it was a really big event in my life. I now feel completely rejected by her, it's been two years and she still won't talk to me. 
After I ""left"" I stayed with a friend for a while but had to leave due to a misunderstanding with his parents. After that I was homeless. I hitch-hiked and traveled for a good while, and met some really good friends. We had a lot of good times and I wouldn't trade those for anything, but I couldn't handle it. I needed some stability. 

I ended up in NV with a friend I met while travelling, and we couch surfed his friend's houses while looking for work. It was his home town so he knew a lot of people. If you've ever been homeless and tried to get a job you know how hard it is. It ended up not working, he had had problems with meth before and he was relapsing, it turned him into a total asshole. So i said fuck it and left the state. 
So I came to colorado, and met a guy who offered me a room in exchange for work until I could get on my feet. I thought I was really lucky, it ended up being another mistake. I worked for him from the beginning of march (this year) until the end of september. He treated me like shit, I worked for him every single day for over 14 hours. EVERY DAY. He didn't pay me besides giving me rent, and my room was literally the size of a closet with no windows. It was big enough for my mattress and a nightstand, I had about 3 square feet of floorspace. I knew it was unfair but there was nothing I could do if I didn't want to be homeless, so I kept pushing myself through it, lying to my dad and other family members and saying everything was ok. I dont know why I didn't tell them the truth, they just all seemed so happy that I was off of the street and I didn't want them to worry about me anymore. 
I met an older lady at one of his houses (he rented rooms), and we became pretty close. She felt bad for me and wanted to move too, so when she ended up finding another place she let me stay with her. 
That brings us to the present. I'm still living with that lady, trying to find work, but I have such a large gap in my work history that it's almost impossible to get hired. I can't use the guy I worked for as a reference because things didn't end well. This lady is supporting me a lot and she's had to go without things she needs because of it. I feel like such a drain and a piece of shit, but I'm helpless. The only family member who still talks to me is my grandma. 

I have one really really good friend who I've known since I was 16, I'm very very much in love with her.. She is the only human being who I feel actually understands me. It's been a few months since we last talked, I send her a message on facebook every once in awhile but she never reads them anymore. We used to talk every day, without her something just feels wrong. I can't explain it, it just doesn't feel right. 

I don't have any friends, every one I used to consider a good friend is now a stranger and has progressed so much farther than me it's like I can't even relate to them. I get the feeling that they all think I need to grow up. I tried calling my dad but he hasn't called back. I keep telling myself he's just busy but I think he doesn't want me to depress him on this day that's supposed to be happy. And I don't blame him, I'd get sick of my son too if I had someone like me as a son. I spent thanksgiving completely alone with no one to talk to at all.

I wonder a lot if continuing to live and fight like this every single day is still worth it, or if I'm just the type of person that doesn't get to have a happy life no matter how much bullshit I have to go through. I can't keep being a financial drain on this lady I'm living with, she doesn't deserve it. 

I don't know what to do. I just want someone who has been in my situation to say that it gets better so I have something to look forward to, because right now I honestly have nothing to live for. So much for keeping it short. "

sickhouserat,5d55ta,1479244972,18 and just don't want to live anymore,"Never really done this before, so I guess I'll start with some background info about myself. I turned 18 a little over a month ago, and it's really hit home how much I've missed in my life. Due to an anxiety disorder and depression, I dropped out of school half way through grade 10, and have spent basically the last 4 years inside.

I've never really had any friends, and the people I did ""hang out"" with would mostly ignore me and talk to each other while I listened. I wasn't able to do any school assignments out of fear of getting the answers wrong and looking like an idiot to the teacher, and my time at home was spent either being screamed at by my mum/older sisters or using the internet so that I could escape all the stress. My 2 older sisters have treated me like shit since as far back as I can remember, and my mum has never done anything to stop them.

I've always been a shy kid, but it got really severe in early grade 10 (when I was maybe 13-14 years old). I even tried to approach my mum about it and get help, but she pretty much told me that I was a liar, that I was lazy and a millstone around her neck. Shortly after that, I stopped going to school because I was so behind on my assignments that I just didn't see any point in it, and my mum sent me to live with my father in a caravan park in another state, though I moved back a few months later.

Since then, my entire life has been spent inside my room at my computer, maybe going outside a few times a month to go to the doctors office. I've been put on Cymbalta (duloxetine) for my anxiety and depression, but as far as I can tell it has stopped working; all it does now is make me feel sick/nauseous when I don't take it, or if I take it without eating (an easy thing to do, since I rarely feel hungry anymore). I feel frustrated and depressed that other people have been able to live like regular teenagers while I've been trapped inside. It's even worse that my younger sister brings her friends over all the time, almost like she's rubbing it in my face that I'm not normal (though I know she's not). 

Every day it feels more and more like there's no point in continuing to live, that even if my condition does improve (unlikely, according to every source I've read), I'll never be able to live happily knowing how much I missed out on as a teenager and young adult. I'm planning to kill myself sometime in the next two weeks, and honestly I don't really think anything you say could convince me not to. Everything in my life is one massive disappointment after the next. Cymbalta stops working, and all the progress I'd made from it is gone. I'm going to get on a disability pension, so now I can finally have money coming in to buy some things that I want (family is very poor); nope, most of that goes towards rent, bills and groceries, leaving me only $40 a week. I'm going to enroll in a TAFE course for captive animal care, which includes 15 hrs a week of volunteer work at an animal shelter. Finally, something I'm interested in; the first thing I've been excited for in 3 years. Nope, no animal shelters have any volunteer spots available, so I can't do it. 

Everything feels completely pointless, and that no matter what good things I think are going to happen, something always comes along to fuck it up. I'm a good person. I don't deserve to suffer like this. I just want to die and for all my troubles to be over. Sorry if I write all over the place, I'm really tired atm."

recovering_dm,5ff6fm,1480376609,Suicide watch,"So my wife was using my phone in bed last night, she couldn't find hers, and she came across some of my search history. Something like ""how many Valium to kill yourself"" came up and she flipped out. I admitted to having curiosity about it, but tried to reassure her that I wasn't going to kill myself, after recently being prescribed the drug to cope with anxiety. I haven't even had to have a tablet in over a week, so I've learnt to cope with the anxiety better, or it has dropped down.

So last time I was going to kill myself, I think it was in 2013 or 2014, I'd dropped my daughter off with her Auntie to look after for the day, then dropped some stuff off at work that I had borrowed from various people. Then I drove off to ""The Gap"" in Sydney. While driving I was taking all of whatever pills I could find, chewing them up because I thought that would make them release better, and then once at The Gap, I waited for the right moment, when there weren't so many people around to witness. Before the moment came a member of the public came up to talk to me and I couldn't make her go away. People were milling around me, and I just couldn't get the opportunity to jump, then the police arrived and I was taken away.

The reason I'm telling this story is to remind myself what my wife went through. She got a call from the police while I was in an ambulance for observation before being taken to the mental health ward at St Vincents hospital. The police took my car and parked it at the local police station, my wife had to arrange with my mate to help her come and pick it up.

It was all a massive inconvenience to her, and she reminds me of that. But she said last night ""I just want to know if you're going to do it.""

Does this become part of my plan now? Do I have to run in past her for approval before I off myself? It seems to me that if you want to commit suicide, the last thing you want to do is tell people you're going to, or they'll stop you."
Hoboman2000,5bof1z,1478548757,I have never felt the urge this strongly,"Maybe it's stress induced. I was in the middle of class just moments ago, and I just stopped caring and was thinking seriously about how to go about it, cutting lengthwise through my forearms in the forest nearby, and how I'd spend my last moments. It's been fairly tough, mostly caused by myself; I've been being lazy, not really putting too much effort into my online course, I have a 5 page paper due tomorrow that I haven't started on, multiple papers and projects due over the next couple weeks plus regular workload, a morbid curiosity with dying and what lies beyond, my own sense of loneliness and inadequacy, and a really odd fascination with just killing myself in general. I get halfway to calling suicide hotlines and going to mental health services on campus, and then I start chastising myself for being weak enough to consider going to therapy. I've come down from my little moment just now, but I'm both really afraid and scarily calm about the whole thing, about how I've been getting progressively closer and closer over the past couple years, how these thoughts have increased in frequency, sometimes emotionally and stress induced, sometimes completely random. There's something oddly comforting in the fact that I can just grab my knife, walk half a mile to a secluded trail nearby, cut my veins and just sit and appreciate the view as I bleed out. I don't know if I'm just crazy or otherwise. The main thing that's kept me going so far is pure spite towards the universe, just mentally thinking 'fuck you, I'm not giving up yet you fucks', but just now that didn't cut it. It's getting harder and harder to remember why I want to stay alive."

pandajean626,5c38n1,1478720696,I hate when people ask me what's wrong....,"As if they actually care. They never ask because they genuinely want to know, it's just another part of the script to make themselves feel better, and I have to come up with some BS answer to satisfy them. Imagine what would happen if I was honest! What do you think they'd do if the next time they asked me what was wrong I responded with ""The fact that I'm still alive, for one..."". I already know what would happen if I said it to my husband. He'd get annoyed and make it about him and remind me how inconvenient it is for him when I'm ""grumpy"". If I said it to my mother she'd blame herself and make me feel guilty for it like she always does... If I said it to my oldest sister she'd probably help me fashion a lovely organic all natural non GMO cyanide cocktail and help to make sure I drink it all, and if I told my other sister she'd probably tell me she doesn't have time to deal with it and that I'm just like my mother. 

It's funny how none of them want to hear about it when I'm here, but I'm sure the second they found me snuggled up with a pistol they'd turn into makeshift detectives trying to figure out just what it was to lead such a ""happy"" person to do something so ghastly with ""no warning""."

nejflo,5ewo5t,1480118946,Suicidal thoughts,"I never feel like I belong anywhere. Even among others with mental illness I find myself sticking out, too functioning to blend in but too sick to be with “normal” people. I struggle to relate and socialize since my illness has had me isolated for years. I don’t feel that I have the skill to join in on small talk or even begin to remotely related to regular everyday struggles. I try my best and in my opinion to do everything right. I take my meds and turn to my doctors when I feel an adjustment is needed. I reach out to my support team when I feel like I’m slipping a bit too far. I find every type of program I qualify for and I join it, whether or not I stick to it is a different story. I’m needy, I know that. I feel abandoned often and I hate being alone. No one can be with me 24/7 that I know. It’s unrealistic. But the connections I have now are not deep. I recently moved away from the one person I cared about most and now our relationship is seeing each other once a week. I know I will never have the life I want with her. That’s what I want. A life. A family to belong to. Loved ones to come home to that miss me when I’ve been gone for a few hours. Someone to banter back and forth with. Someone who challenges me in all the best ways. A stable home to call my own. Not setting up shop inside someone else’s life. I’ve been living through others for a long time. I don’t know who I am or what my own life should be like but I know its not this, its not what it is now. Moved from one place to avoid feeling like I could get thrown out on the street at any moment to actually being on the verge of being homeless. Bouncing from one person’s home to another never feeling safe or stable. Therefore my moods are never safe and stable. I can adjust my meds all I want but no one can change the circumstances that cause my moods to fluctuate. I’m always on the edge of falling into a pit of deep despair. I’m told I am cared about and loved but for some reason I barely feel it. I’m well enough to know exactly what’s wrong with me and why, but nothing I do fixes it. It’s ongoing, relentless and has been destroying my sense of self for years. When things get tough all amounts of joy vanish. Simple pleasures like playing a video game or watching my favorite tv show provoke no emotions from me. Only one emotion exists and that’s sadness. Even while medicated, seeing a therapist, going to a day center with others like me, reaching out to the few friends I have, nothing lifts me out of depression. And once that happens, then it’s a snowball effect. Everything sad, hurtful, traumatic that has ever happened throughout my life revisits my mind like new all at once. Now it becomes not just about possibly being homeless, but it becomes about having a traumatic childhood, its about having been abused, it’’s about never finishing school due to a brain tumor &amp; learning disabilities, its about not being close with my siblings, its about having an alcoholic father. The list goes on forever. Once that terrible chain reaction starts its impossible to get back to a base line of normalcy.

This negative, compulsive, repetitive thought process is what leads some to thoughts of suicide. If I’m already receiving the help I supposedly need and already am trying my best to combat my condition what else is there? I’m not religious so I don’t turn to faith or God. I try to be Buddhist and accept things for the way they are and realize that everything is temporary. But one thing that is not temporary is my condition. I’ve been dealing with these feelings since early childhood. Therapy since I was as young as 8 years old. People say feelings come and go and that situations are temporary and that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. But If you’ve battled mental illness for as long as I have, if you’ve dealt with these relentless feelings of despair no matter how many medications you take or therapy groups you join, self help books you read, then you too might start to see the appeal to finding a permanent way to end your permanent suffering. I believe that some people are broken and can’t be fixed. I believe that even if I was given everything I’ve ever wanted right now I would still be depressed. Why? because that’s what mental illness is. I don’t know if I was born this way or my traumatic childhood made me this way but it’s permanent and I can’t change that. I’ve often been told to look at children who have cancer. To think of those less fortunate than me. To count my blessings and concentrate on the positives. I have family, we may fight, and stop talking to each other but I still have siblings who care and a mother who loves me like crazy no matter what. I’ve never been homeless, It could happen soon but as of right now this minute I have a roof over my head and a warm bed to sleep in. I’ve never gone hungry and I have clean clothes to wear. I have a few people I call friends though we rarely see each other. I am grateful for those things yes. That should be enough for happiness, but its not. That’s what mental illness is. Despair that sucks that hope out of everything no matter what viewpoint you have. Nothing anyone can say will make my life better. People tell me it’s up to me to CHOOSE to be happy. It’s up to me to “fight it”. “it” being depression. I go down a checklist of distractions and things to do to get myself out of my own head. I’ve even volunteered at animal shelter to give me a sense of purpose. I’m a member at fountain house where I get assigned jobs that help the community run. I have way more than many others, I count my blessings and i’m still DEEPLY depressed. That’s what mental illness is. Despite your best efforts this illness can come at any moment and ruin your progress and swallow you whole.

I am aware that their are many people with mental illness who are stable and leading happy productive lives. Good for them. But I’m not one of those people. Maybe I’m treatment resistant. Maybe I need to forgo meditations and go for electro convulsive therapy. its the only treatment left I haven’t tried. yes it causes significant short term and long term memory loss. Maybe i will lose some of the bad memories but maybe id lose the few good ones. Its a controversial treatment for sure and its used as a last resort for treatment resistant people. my therapist even suggested I research it. So far it has favorable reviews despite the memory loss. How sad it is that I have to consider sending volts of electricity through my brain to see if it lifts me out of this depression. To top it off I’ve read the results are temporary and i will need periodic treatments for “maintenance.” Again a permanent problem. This is what mental illness is. A life threatening, permanent condition that devastates your life.

lately everyday I am unsure if I can make it through the day. but somehow I do. I keep telling myself empty promises that tomorrow will be better, it will get better. but it never does. "

hell_phone,5aoe52,1478067112,"I don't feel purpose anymore, I'm getting there","hey everyone, I don't think it will make much of a difference but I decided I'll give it a shot right now, 

I'll let you know about myself first,  I'm 26,  I'm blind in one eye due a genetic condition, and I've always had an insecurity complex. Lately I was just fine but since me and my girlfriend have been having problems I feel like she's about to break up with me, which even if she doesn't at this point, this relationship is dead,  she says she feels chained to me, might as well let her be without me, I got nothing else to live for, my parents are gone got no siblings and my only 2 friends are 2 19 years old kids who  really can't help me that much since their lives are pretty much  as empty as it gets, no jobs, no college no interest on either of those things, no girlfriend or desire to get one, yeah it pretty much drives me to the same place... no purpose.

I want to just end it. Stop feeling so void. I don't even care for the future, everything seems so pointless... All I care would be taken away from me by me losing my eyes, and I have no real life peopel around me.

I am honestly getting to the point and I need help before I lose it and do it.

Sorry for the long and terrible read. English isn't my  first language.

Raizerback45,5ewuj0,1480121259,"I think I need some help, friends, but I don't know what that is, or where to get it.","Let me start things off by stating that I'm relatively young, 17, and I've never been depressed before. Or even really sad for that matter. I know there's a good chance that everything I'm feeling is just teen angst, but I can't exactly make that judgement for myself. I know it's kind of stupid and shallow to kill yourself over a girl, but allow me to explain my circumstances. It was both of our first relationship, and we'd been together for around 5 years. Every formative experience that I've had as a human being was had by her side, with her best interest at the forefront. I never really asked for much and always did as much as I could for her because, really, it was making her happy that made me happy. It was incredible to figure out the ebb and flow of growing up with another person. But that's all done now. She left me cold, I still don't know why, everything was perfect, like it always had been. But if it makes her happy to be away from me then that's how it has to be. Anyways, without the distraction of her in my life the realization has set in that I've grown to despise most of the people that surround and love me, and nothing I make myself do makes me happy anymore. I don't think it's just a time thing either, I've let this whole thing fester in me for a good while and its only gotten worse. I feel incredibly lost and isolated. I can't even talk to anyone, and by extension I can't talk to anyone about not being able to talk to anyone. I haven't eaten in a couple days now, and all I can think about is taking my own life. Any attempt to distract myself with other thoughts or activities just feels hollow and everything just circles back to grief. I don't feel like I have a place anymore, and I'd rather end things off as close to a high note as I have than let it wither and trickle down to even more nothingness. Pretty much everything in my life has been honestly perfect up until the last few weeks, I know life is going to be rocky and bumpy and unsatisfying from now on, so why even give the effort? You turn off a movie if it gets shitty halfway through right? I'd rather my mark here be a perfect succinct little nugget than a drawn out fest of uncertainties and hardship. My plan is to write a personalized letter to everyone in my life that I care about, I've written 3 so far. I think I'm going to dress up, head down to the river I used to play in when I was five years old, and slit my writs so that the red runs with the water. Seems fitting, if melodramatic enough. Please, I don't know if I'm asking for help, or support, or deterrent, but I know I need something. I don't know if the course I'm taking is the right one, but I also don't know how to find out what is. "

notathrowaway144,5agias,1477964708,Four years of this and nothing has gotten better 16M,"I've posted on this forum so many fucking times it's ridiculous. So to make this post easier to read I'll just divide my post into the different facets of my life that are terrible and make me wanna kill myself

Friends: I did cut off contact with a group of three friends that always used to bully me (unwanted touching, ENDLESS racist/height/weight/appearance jokes, tying me up and beating me when I said i wanted to transfer to a different class, etc.) but since i'm a useless shit who's even more suicidal when alone i reestablished contact. But during this time I also got two new friend groups at my new school. The first group includes a bunch of kids who are first-gen immigrants and identify strongly with their punjabi background, and since i grew up hating my culture cause of bullying i dont really identify with it. This is apparently a fucking capital crime because whenever i hang out with them at lunch they always make fun of me and how i cant speak my native language and how im really unmasculine for punjabi guys and how its gay and faggy that i like english and reading and stuff. The second group doesn't make fun of me like that, but i feel like im too ""uncool"" and too much of a fucking loser for them. Whenever I talk with them I always feel like an outsider, and they always hang out with each other but forget to invite me. Usually the only times we do hang out is when they need a ride somewhere or a ride home, and since my lonely whore ass will do anything for company I accept. And on top of that my original group of friends (the ones that bullied me) are always calling me unloyal and untrustworthy and a snake whenever i hang out with my new friends, so idk what to do. 

Body: I'm a fucking prime example of what a man shouldn't be in terms of appearance.To start off, my face is really quite ugly and disturbing in my opinion. My nose is too long and big, my forehead is too wide, i have acne and oily skin that doesn't go away with home remedies or with medecine but is jusst mild enough so that theres no point in seeing a dermatologist, i have a creepy stare (a lot of girls say i look ""intense"" and that when I look at people they feel like I'm trying to change who they are as a person, among other things), my eyes are way too big (girls say that my eyes are really good and big and nice and would be fantastic for makeup but i feel like they're lying) and my jawline isn't quite prominent at all. I'm even skinnier than I was a year ago when I last posted here, and being 5ft5 and 100lbs makes me a fucking hideous zombie. I tried weightlifting for two years but i cant stick to it because a)i cant make myself enjoy weightlifting no matter how hard i want to b)i have a really shitty diet schedule and I can only force myself to eat a certain amount of food (add that to the fact that im on vyvanse for adhd and that makes me avoid food) c) i cant make myself lift most days because im either too tired from school, have too much shit to do or my self-hating gets the best of me and i see no point in even trying. My entire body from head to toe is repulsive, which brings me to my next point.

Girls: I feel like girls are disgusted by the sight of me and don't want anything to do with me. This school year had some ""exceptions"" but i feel like they don't count. One i can remember is that I was coming home on the train when an attractive girl asked me for my phone so she could call her dad. I agreed, but when i got off the train my friends (who were with me) were jokingly mad at me because she was apparently like giggling at me and smiling at me and waiting for me to make a move. There's also another girl in one of my classes who i occassionally talk to and she once said she ""fangirled"" over me because according to her im smart, i dress well, im funny and i speak french (?). But I feel like none of these girls actually want me, especially not when there's so many jacked, tall, more attractive guys out there. I'm a fucking hideous short skinny faggot. Why would any girl want me? And if they did why would they stay with me? Nearly every guy out there is better than me in one or more ways, and there's no way a girl could see them and then choose me out of all of the other options. It hurts to see all my friends getting laid and talking to girls like Casanovas, while the most i can muster is shy, friendly conversations that make the girl think im a pussy, that I'm a sorry excuse for the confident, charismatic womanizer men are supposed to be.

Sexuality: I've come to realize that i might be bisexual, and mainly because i find myself staring at other attractive guys sometimes and wishing to be with them. My last ""real"" crush was on the guy I shared a room with in the psych ward, but I wish i could forget all these feelings. All my friends are extremely homophobic, and my parents even more so. There's no way to be accepted in my friend group, and even if i found some friends who actually accepted my pathetic self i'd have to come out to my parents one day, and they'd disown me for sure. I've tried conversion therapy at home and it didnt work but i wish it did. I wish i could cut off all the parts of me that are attracted to men because Im so ashamed of it. And im a fucking hypocrite too, because I hate the gay part of me yet i very vocally support lgtbqa rights.

Family: My parents are loving but unreasonably strict at times. They wont let me go out with friends late even though i give good reasons (no homework, friends arent bad influences, etc.). I also can't talk to them about my mental health stuff because after i landed in the psych ward for attempted suicide in december 2014 my dad told me that if i kept on talking about suicide and if i wasnt getting better he'd kill himself, which kinda made me make myself look ""cured"" overnight. They also don't know that im atheist, and when i told them i left islam in the psych ward they threatened to kick me out on the streets to be a homeless waste (their exact words) and only calmed down when i said i was just a questioning muslim. On top of this they're forcing me to do accounting in uni, and said that I HAVE to go to the university in my city and they wont let me go anywhere else, even after i said i could get scholarships. I also said i could take a gap year to earn money for it but they responded with a harsh no. They dont want me leaving the house or their watch until im 31, and to most white ppl on the sub this seems ridiculous but i feel like i wont be able to fight it because they'll use blackmail, threats of suicide, they'll bring up how hard their jobs are (surgical cleaner and factory supervisor) and how hard they worked and that all i need to do to pay them back is to become an accountant (even though i hate the idea of it and i strongly dislike math).

Life: School is going fairly well (88% average at the moment, but only because my courses right now are biology, french and english). For some reason i feel like i've legitimately gotten dumber and less physically coordinated over the years, which kinda worries me. I also notice that i my ADHD seems to be worsening because I can't make myself do anything important (like schoolwork and fitness) but i can do my work only at the last minute, which fucks me over a lot. It's also hard to do work because i spend around 2-4 hours a day either anxious, stressed, self-hating or a combination of the three. I can't get any help for it because my therapist and psychologist havent called back in atleast five months, and whenever i call them im sent to voicemail. I'm also really really worried about the future. I want to become a writer for a magazine or a journalist, but the job market for these jobs seems horrible. The only other option i've found to be good is a police officer, but i dont want ptsd from the job added on to all my mental fuckery and i know for a fact that the police force wants tall, muscular, imposing members, not short, skinny and hopelessly useless people like me. 

To sum it up, I'm a hideous, grotesque joke that has no real friends, that cant get girls, that has parents who dictate his life and a brain thats probably falling apart. I also come to the internet to cry about my bitch ass because there's no one i can talk to in real life. I want there to be a solution to my problems so badly, but the only solution i can see is suicide. The world doesn't want me, and it'd probably be better for everyone i know if i left. I wish i actually had some initiative to die by my own doing, but for now its even worse since i can only mope around and let these thoughts torture me."

throwawaydude2000,5au94b,1478139831,"Trying, but failing. Tired of being a disappointment to my family and myself. Need a reality check. Why should I go on?","On the surface, one would say I'm a relaxed, happy person. I've got a lot going for me. I have a loving and supporting family, I go to a great university, and I couldn't ask for better friends. But this life I lead is a lie. The truth is that I trudge through life because it is expected of me. I maintain a good appearance to avoid confrontation with others. I am tired. I tire of having to deal with the judgments of others, and the relentless and boring influx of pointless work.
 
I look for escapes from reality whenever I can. Video games, movies, books, sleeping in 'til the afternoon, booze, marijuana... You name it. I hate real life, and I look for every opportunity to ignore it. It would seem that I have lost my sense of place here. I no longer see the point in going to school, attending classes that I hate just to graduate and work some mundane job for the rest of my life. Call me spoiled, but the future can only get worse for me. Why should I go on in a dull and pointless life in a bleak world?

In seeking ways to keep myself going, I have sacrificed aspects of my life. I rarely talk to my parents, am failing all of my classes, and will be kicked out of college. Given, however, I always hated college. I hide myself whenever possible. I try to come up with some reason to live... And for what? To come here I guess...

I have tried talking to counselors and therapists about my... problems. But I have never felt they have helped. I used to take anti-depressants, but they never truly helped either. I know that I am my own worst enemy, and should keep seeking help. But I feel as though I am the only person capable of getting me out of this hole. And I have given up. I know that these feelings will plague me for the rest of my life... No one seems to understand.

So. I ask you, why should I continue if I cannot find joy or passion in life? It is true, that my friends and family would be devastated, but they will get over it. They are the lucky ones, who have something to live for. Me? I see no reason. No higher purpose. Nothing at all..."
weakmoves,5aul41,1478144207,Day and night its all I really think about.,"I literally say ""I'm going to kill myself"" every couple of minutes it seems. i recently got out of mental hospital where i was put in for slashing my wrist open again. i tried the same method a few years back and i failed then to. im just so tired of being a disappointment to everyone around me. But at this point i dont think anyone really cares not a single person in my family has even attempted to talk to me since i got out of the hospital. the medication im on i fucking hate. the only good stuff they proscribed(sleeping pills because i never fucking sleep) me i cant afford because my shitty job pays me just enough for me to pay rent car payment and insurance and if im lucky after scraping by i can buy my prescription but the hospital stay put me way behind on everything i was already behind on. I just dont see a point guys. I have been planning on stealing one of my brothers guns and an emergency 30 day supply of food kit and disappearing into the mountains where i can just be away from everything and everyone and clear my head. I have had suicide letters written out to people i actually have something to say to for going 5 months. The last year of my life i went from having my own place and girlfriend that i loved more then i could love myself. I fucked everything up i've tried so hard to be strong. being strong is just something i never was good at."
WholeLottaGlove,5f9mmp,1480306122,My sister and her boyfriend moved across the country Thursday and now I have no one,"My sister and her boyfriend moved away Thursday. They had been living with my mom and I for about 2 months in our basement to prepare for the move. I wasn't even really upset until they were actually gone. (This is all about my sister. Her boyfriend is a good dude but this isn't about him, just a side note) I'm a 16 year old male (11th grade) and I have bad social anxiety, so my sister was my only friend. She was the only one I could go to with my problems (both my parents are in my life and I love them but they can be hard to communicate with). She has the same parents and almost always understand what I'm going through. She relates to me probably more than anyone. I've cried a few times since she left and I'm not even a big cryer. I get very upset whenever I go into the basement half expecting her to be there but all their stuff is gone and the basement is empty. I also go back to school tomorrow, as we had been on a week long break for thanksgiving. The stress is piling on and I don't know how to deal with this. I miss my sister so much. This is only a recent problem, add this onto my social anxiety, depression, and OCD and I don't think I can go on much longer. I don't want to die but I want to stop feeling so constantly shitty, so I do want to die in that regard, if that makes sense. "

tinyrezzy,5fna7g,1480475969,I'm lost and feel like there is no hope,"I've always thought about suicide. I've always been, what people used to call me, ""melancholic"" when I was a child. From 15 to 17 I suffered bad with anorexia to the point I didn't get my periods for 9 months so my mom took me to a doctor and they made me eat again... I've gotten better (though I still feel like I'm huge at size 4) from the anorexia but not from the anxiety and depression. I'm now 27, I have a job and used to live with my boyfriend. In this period we've been together, I called the Suicide Line once, but I never told him that. I had a breakdown while he was out with his friends and cut my arms and destroyed a notebook I had trying to distract me from hurting myself even more. Today he broke up with and he's moving to another country, whereas I'm going to stay in this hell hole I live and die here... We've planned all of it together. We were going to get married but he went crazy today thinking that I cheated on him with an old friend from college with whom I had a thing once, way before I started dating my boyfriend.  And now he won't believe me, I see no future ahead of me other than staying in a job I don't, making barely enough to survive and depending on my parents forever. I am back at the point where I imagine all possible waya of dying without it looking like suicide... So my family won't feel like it's their fault - because it's not. Sorry for rambling, I'm a mess."

However, where it is legal, can only be done if you're terminally ill.

Hoshino_Yumemi,5ar05d,1478105280,I've been thinking about this.,"You know, it's funny. If you talk to my direct family they'll tell you that's one thing I never do. I don't know if this is all in my head or if that's a good assessment of me, and maybe if that's why I should check out, well...I'd rather know one way or the other before nobody has a chance to tell me anymore.

I think this all seriously started about nine years ago. I graduated high school, was rewarded for earning an honors scholarship and advanced placement at a respected state college for engineering with a cruise around the Mediterranean, seen the world...I thought I was going places. I thought I was smart, confident, that I could handle myself no matter what happened...

Then I make a mess of things in my freshman year because nobody really told me how to live life away from parental supervision after basically having lived everything according to looking for their approval. I had to report some awful grades, actually got called an asshole over it, had practically my only mode of contact with what friends I had left from high school taken from me for a while, felt awful about myself.

Things got worse. I failed out of my scholarship and as the years passed, got hit with an academic suspension. Spent a year at community college struggling to get back into a respectable school, in hindsight I'm not entirely sure why, and I hated it and myself the whole way.

Therapy was a constant problem. Now aware of how expensive I was becoming, and with my family convinced it was because I was an internet addict (rather than it being a band-aid over some deeper issues, having lost friends, been left behind as they all graduated, having no other human contact than a computer and allowing myself no other pleasures because I don't ever see myself as boyfriend material) it was half of me watching everything I said when one of my parents was on the couch with me and half of me trying to figure out if my medication was doing anything. And if it wasn't, I'd never breathe a word of it because it was expensive and everyoe wanted me off it as soon as I could manage it. Credit to my folks, they're really trying, but I don't think the pressure to get better fast helped, nor did this being at a time when I was furiously struggling to get my life back on track do much either.

I was off my medication within a year and it barely helped. In hindsight, without it I've become even worse, trying to self-medicate with the only thing I feel like I've ever been good at other than the odd video game, having basically pressured myself out of enjoying them: comedy.

I live in a constant wash of background noise, which makes everyone around me, especially my mother, who doesn't deserve to have to put up with the failure I've become, think I'm not thinking about the future. I am, and that's why I'm trying to drown myself in endorphins, neurotransmitters and the other natural make-happy bits of my brain so I'm not trapped alone with my darker thoughts. When I am, I'd want to lash out but everything around me is too precious, and in my current state, I'm reminded that it's really been bought with someone else's money. I'm trying to remind myself that things are good and that I should work to keep them that way, but everything I do seems to conspire to ensure they won't be, and that it's all my fault. If only, perhaps, I hadn't aspired. If only I didn't dream so much or dare to be anything other than some obscure greeter or laborer somewhere, hating his life and trying to work a numbing pain away after having lived the good life and proving he wasn't good enough to keep it.

My future is having a GPA too low to put on a resume, no work experience, no portfoilo to soften the blow, and having an awful time trying to find good things to say about myself so a skills-based resume is out. I'm too overqualified and too old to dig ditches and spent too much money to quit that all for a menial job without finally ending it all out of shame. I don't want to become another topic of discussion, like all the other failures we tend to gossip over at the dinner table, and with an older sister who's successful and just seems to be making more and more money hand over fist, they at least have someone they can be proud of from now on. Me, I'm looking at classes I'll be late for registering for thanks to needing advisor meetings which I didn't think would immediately get stuffed, and looking at time running out for my tenure in college, with the threat of all my credits, work, and money sunk into me to be there being thrown out and meaning absolutely nothing.

I can't bear to go through all that again. I'd be doing everyone a favor if I quit everything now, or at least soon.

Friends tell me I'm a good writer and that I have potential there, but I know I'm too strange to get readers and it probably wouldn't work anyway; the world just won't let it. Good outcomes are for other people. Nobody would want to see someone like me settle for data entry, anyway. Who knows, by the time that happens, maybe typists won't be necessary anymore.

I have a plan, but nobody outside me and a few other people get to know it. I thought I'd do it when I was 21 and suspended because then I had nothing left to live for, then I thought I'd do it when I was 25 because it was, according to me, a nice, round number. Two years on, and here I am, still alive, knowing how much my absence would hurt what friends I've made, in a place everyone around me tells me doesn't matter, and probably won't because as good as I supposedly can be...despite proof that I'm probably not even as entertaining as the next guy on the internet, or maybe that I'm just not meant to be lucky enough to earn my break...good things are supposed to happen to good people, and I guess that's not me.

It is, at least, a future, one where maybe I'll be in a better place than this. If not, well, I suppose it's the punishment that I've had coming to me for a long time. Either way, I won't be homeless, I won't be a drain, and I won't have to worry about my fluctuating health and the many risk factors I've inherited for cardiovascular problems, diabetes risk and blood pressure. Even if I'm the only person who can give life to creations brimming with potential, potential that goes nowhere is wasted energy, so perhaps nobody will be missing much if nobody continues to breathe life into them after I'm gone.

Life will go on, people will move on, and eventually they'll forget. I'll ultimately mean nothing, which is only appropriate. And if anybody wants to decide whether or not I made a terrible mistake, well, the web has a long memory, and maybe someone will find all my stillborn thoughts and get to judge for themselves."

I'm just so weak and tired, and I don't know what else to do but vent. I figured I might as well spill everything out somewhere, in case I do go through with it tonight. So here it goes - my pathetic life - and all the pathetic excuses I'm making for it.

I have always been depressed, ever since I can remember. I hated living from a very young age. My dad was partial to belt beatings. He'd hit us for arguing over stupid video games. He'd hit us for stressing out our mother too much. He'd try to make us hit each other, if we got into any physical altercations. He only stopped hitting us with the belt when he decided we were ""too old"" for it - a bit after my little brother got out of elementary school, if I recall. His punishments were always either very painful or very bizarre - my sister and I weren't allowed to speak to each other at all for a month once when we were both in elementary school. For refusing to go with my family on a paddle boat (I was and am very scared of water - I still can barely swim) when I was also quite young, I wasn't allowed to use any technology for a whole summer. That included television, our computer, any video games, etc. Sounds quite tame, really, but for a friendless homebody of a little girl like me, that summer was pretty terrible. The point is that he was, and is, a very weird man. He really did a number on my mind, and I grew so resentful that I refused to acknowledge him whenever possible. The tension was palpable whenever he came home from work, and I can still remember the stomach knots his very presence induced. He even make growling noises like an animal when he was angry - I was so terrified of him.

Here's another tidbit: I had to live with an uncle who, to put it lightly, acted very inappropriately towards me. He's my dad's half brother who was a teenager when I was a child, so he was sort of like a big brother to me. The things he did aren't nearly as bad as they could have been, thank God. But he did some very shameful things and touched me in ways that still make me cry when I think about them. I hate him for that, but I hate myself more for not standing up to him. I guess I just didn't know how to tell my parents that a man they trusted so much was being so disgusting to his niece. By the time I confessed to my mom what had happened, he hadn't lived with us for years, and he was married. So we all just kind of let it be.

Soon came the living hell that is teeangedom. I became bulimic (still am today) in middle school, partially because I started forcing myself to throw up to have something to convince my mom that I was sick. That way, I wouldn't have to go and face everyone who was making fun of me for being fat, pimply, and poor.

My family has never had very much money. We've never been turned out onto the streets, thankfully, but the five of us have lived in single bedroom apartments together. My dad liked to remind us that a lot of people lived poorer than we did, and even had the nerve to tell me and my siblings that we were spoiled. Us, who wore the same ragged clothes to school year after year to save money. Us, who wouldn't complain when we had to go days without food.

Eventually we declared bankruptcy.

I later found out, through a confusing conversation with a teacher at school, that my dad had cheated on my mother and was paying for another kid he never intended to tell me about. And I hate him for it. Not the money he was spending, but for cheating on my mom. She is so wonderful, and the only reason I'm still alive right now to write this. She didn't deserve that humiliation and unfaithfulness. She is still with him today, though. My mother is nothing if not dedicated.

So then I entered high school. Somehow I remained a straight A student, even though I cried myself to sleep every night and still had not a single friend. People started a rumor that I was gay, which was all but a death sentence in a school as white and rich and heterosexual as the one I attended. The guy I had once had a crush on thought it was hilarious to make fun of me for it, but only behind my back. I also remember distinctly the moment people told me about how he'd spent part of a class period detailing how ugly I was. 

When I finally was allowed to see a doctor in my senior year for my ""condition"" (aka wanting to die every single day and crying constantly), I was diagnosed with both depression and severe anxiety. I have taken medication for both every since. It helped at first, even as a placebo, if only to cope with the fact that my family was falling apart. My sister was making my mom cry all the time and my brother was suffering from an even more extreme anxiety than my own. And my dad was ... well, my dad.

But whatever. That's high school, right? It's terrible for 90% of people.

I'm currently in my third year of college, and I can't stand it. I've managed to get As and ABs in most of my classes, but I've had so many close calls that were only saved thanks to professors who allowed me to use my terrible personal life as an excuse. And last semester, I got my first F. That, ladies and gentlemen, above all else, made me want to die more than ever. I have never not been able to keep up my appearances of a mildly impressive academic with a promising future. I failed that class and nearly lost my campus job in the same semester because I couldn't fake it anymore.

I was even more disenchanted with life and college when I found out my sister, who I'd always looked up to, had been lying to us for years. I think she has a genuine mental problem when it comes to telling the truth - she makes up weird stuff all the time, lies about going to events and hanging out with people that don't exist. She lied about her grades, and lied about money that my parents were giving to her while she resided on campus (the dorm comes with a built-in meal plan, but my sister lied and said she needed hundreds a month for food and ""other things""). My dad actually freaking paid her that money. I have no idea why other than he thought it really was necessary to her academic career - if nothing else, my dad prides himself on bragging about how accomplished/talented his kids are to other people. Even when we're not. But anyway, my sister's lies caught up with her this past year. She was kicked out of her dorm and the school still won't let her back in; I don't know the exact details, but apparently her roommates had accused her of stealing and some drugs that hadn't been prescribed to her were found in her dorm. She's currently living like a leech with my brother and doing nothing productive, not even working like he is. And I don't know if she ever intends to go back. Seeing her fall out like that made me feel even less motivated to work hard.

My depression and anxiety hit a high point after that - I even broke down crying in front of a class once, and only because I was singled out my the professor for not having a group to join for a project. He was trying to help, and I started wailing and shaking like a baby. I don't know if I have never been more embarrassed. My inability to cope with even mundane situations is staggering.

And it was some time after that incident, my friends, I entered the curious world of dating. I met a guy online through a video game forum who I came to really trust and love. Because I had never met anyone who liked me, I let him get away with a lot of things that I shouldn't have. Like making terribly explicit comments about things he wanted to do to me that made me sick to my stomach. And guilt tripping me into sending him nudes. And constantly talking about marriage, because he was Mormon and could only do all this perverse stuff to me if we got married. When I called things off because I was finally fed up with it all, he made horrible comments about me to our mutual friends. He said that I hadn't given him enough notice, and that I was just giving up on him because he was having a ""rough time"" and had ""put up with me lots of times"". I was amazed to realize how much I now hated this man I was once considering marrying, and I'm sad to say he actually made me feel guilty for dumping him. Then he threatened suicide because I wasn't responding to his texts, which is the most disgusting thing I have ever experienced in my life. I knew him well - he wasn't depressed or in danger of hurting himself. He simply wanted attention from me, and I fell for it, because even though I was 100% certain he wouldn't do it, I still wanted to help if I could. He has since cut off all ties with me and is engaged to be married to another girl I can only hope he treats better than me.

Then I met another man on the internet, who I also thought I really loved. This one went much better. He was sweet and courteous and never guilt tripped me into anything. We met up in real life and I was somewhat happy for the first time in years. But it was bittersweet - another very close friend of mine who always talked in skype chats with us was hurt because he had feelings for me too. We tried to patch things up but he couldn't do it. He and I haven't spoken for months, and I don't know how to approach him again, or if I even should. It's really depressing when giving yourself a little happiness hurts someone else so badly.

And then, as time went on, I started to feel less and less attracted to my boyfriend. He thinks it's my depression affecting my feelings, and maybe it is, but I'm more inclined to think I just can't commit myself romantically. We're still ""dating"" but I just feel like his friend, really. I feel so terrible that I seemingly grew bored with this relationship within just a few months; here I have a wonderful young man who truly seems in love with me, and I can't return those feelings. I don't know what to do. In about a month we plan on meeting up again, and I know I won't be able to bring myself to act affectionately toward him. I hate myself so much, and I don't understand why my stupid brain just decided not to like him romantically anymore despite him being so fantastic. Yet another man whose heart will be broken because of my stupidity.

He and the other man I mentioned are the only friends I have ever really had. Losing both? I don't know if I can handle it.

And I continue to make a fool of myself in life, especially when it comes to school. I wait for days to check important emails simply because confrontation makes me sick. This week, I am struggling to declare a major so I can sign up for classes, and I have no idea what I'm doing. I've made the problem worse and last longer by being scared of interaction, and I didn't sign up for the program required to declare the minor I want because I was so uncertain about whether I wanted to do it, even now. But I NEED to declare something right now that counts as a valid academic plan, and I honestly don't know what to do. I have no passion for anything, and I know that I'd be doing a disservice to the profession if I even managed to get a job somewhere down the line. I'm so panicked and avoiding real life like a child - how the hell will I be able to handle having a career when I cry at the drop of a hat?! When I refuse to check emails because it will mean I have to deal with something?! When I am content to stay lazy and behind everyone else?!

I am so disappointed and ashamed of myself. I have only one friend who has to hear about and deal with the brunt of my problems; I can't even be thankful enough for him to spare him my whining. I cry to my mom when things get even a little tough for me. I have my parents fill out stuff for me and set up appointments because being on a phone can give me a panic attack. I can't drive either, because it gives me anxiety. I hurt so many people with my fluctuating feelings and inability to commit. I make excuses constantly for my laziness and poor grades, using my depression as a crutch and expecting professors to make allowances for me. I can't act responsibly and maturely when in a professional setting, and any form of criticism can make my tears well up. I don't have any passion to go into a career - I'm burned out before ever stepping foot into it. I'm a waste of space coasting through life and watching it slowly fall apart, as grades fall and friends leave and I turn more and more into whimpering, sad excuse for an adult.

I considered taking a semester off, maybe to focus on getting help, but now I think that would worsen my situation if anything. A break from anxiety will only make it harder to deal with. I wish this worked like getting over other things does - the constant exposure to discomfort hasn't strengthened my resolve at all. I'm weaker with each new challenge I take on. Even this post is pathetic. I don't have real problems. I'm just so incapacitated by my depression and anxiety that I can't function like a normal person. I don't know what to do. I just want to stop feeling such overwhelming panic and sadness and fear every other minute.

I have really violent panic attacks, where my muscles flare with pain and I collapse in a heap, and my heart feels like someone's stabbing it. And all of this over really mundane problems. And that's why I want to end it all, at the ripe old age of 21. Not just because my life really sucks, but because I can't even handle normal, everyday human stuff without having a meltdown.

To everyone suffering, I'm sorry for writing this. I don't deserve to. I just needed an anonymous place to post this, to make it seem like I'm somewhat significant."

Its nighttime now and I've barely made anything, I feel physically and mentally blocked every time I try to make something.

A ""demo"" presentation of this project will happen in two weeks, the final one in three. I'm getting so anxious about it than I'm becoming sick, it has never happened to me before. I struggle with depression and anxiety for years now, but I don't know if I've ever felt so bad as now.

I keep questioning my capabilities of delivering a project worth of graduating, asking myself why I couldn't just start it before, why did I waited so long? I keep thinking I'll fail, that there's no way I'm going to graduate with the other students. If that happens, I'll have to wait another year to do this, meaning I'll loose an entire year. I don't even want to think about how my parents would react to this, they never tolerated bad grades and my mother always said failing a year ""is not an option"" ever since high school. WHY COULDN'T I JUST START THIS BEFORE, WHEN I WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE A LITTLE PROGRESS EACH DAY INSTEAD OF LETTING IT ACCUMULATE TO THE POINT I WANT TO CRY

I'm angry that I'm putting myself through this, I wouldn't be as worried had I started working on this before. At this point I don't give a shit if my project is not the best, I just want to pass. Right now I'm fighting the urge to grab a knife and just kill myself, save me from this anxiety and of the possibility of not graduating. 

I've never felt so bad, this coupled with all the shitty things going on in my life make me feel so powerless. I don't want to have to tell my parents I won't graduate this year, I prefer death, and I'm not sure if I can resist the urges anymore, I've been postponing them for too long."

[deleted],5fdb16,1480357958,I give up.. This life wasn't meant for me anyway,"I'm a 23 M in France right now. My story starts quite well in Africa where I finished high school with the best results of my country and got a grant to come study in  France. 
My first year here was fine but in the following one,  I became depressed as hell and started missing some class.  I managed to still be the best student with best results of my school but they kicked me out because I had way too many absences.  From there things started going downhill pretty quickly . 
This year I still managed to get an engineering school but after one month of class,  I was told that my grant was cancelled since I changed of school . Then I had to drop out and find me a way to make some  money to fund my "" future""studies and pay some debts I have.  It's been weeks I'm looking for a job but nothing.. 
I got no family here,  my former friends here distanced themselves the minute they knew that I got kicked out of that school. Plus my former best friend got with my ex girlfriend so making friends is just not something I want right now. 
My studies were everything for me and I blew it for stupid reasons.  I'm depressed af,  drown in debt and alone for weeks.. The only way out that I see is killing myself.  
The only thing that prevented me from doing it were my religious beliefs but now I don't fucking care anymore.. I've been thinking about it from the get go but now it's not just an idea.  I've been avoiding talking to my family for a week now cause it would break me so much given what I'm preparing to do.  They had high hopes from me and I screwed all up. 
I guess I deserve this shit after all. 
I don't know when I'm going to do it but it's all ready and I'm an impulsive guy.  It could happen any time now.

I apologise for the long text ahead but I'm by no means forcing anyone to read it because it doesn't have any value anyway and it would probably make more sense to just ignore all this and continue managing one's duties. Also, I'm really terrible at expressing myself so this'll be a major disaster.

I don't know where or how to begin but I guess I'll just start at the beginning. So I've only been alive for 16 years yet and to be honest, I would have never imagined that I would feel so worthless and not care about my life anymore one day. It all started after the first semester in 9th grade two years ago when something inside of me suddenly started to crack. I'm still not sure (and no one's able to tell me) what caused all this to happen, but I have some hypotheses. So first of all, I should actually have no reason to be THIS sad and it makes me feel so guilty. My parents are divorced, but it's been like that for more than 10 years already and I think I wouldn't want to change that since I'm staying at my dad's place every weekend, my parents don't hate each other or anything, my stepfather isn't too bad either and my little sister can be really nice to be around at times, too. I used to have a really awesome group of friends but we kind of drifted apart after most of them changed schools and also, I used to be one of the best students in class back then (maybe because my mom put and still puts a lot of pressure on me to only come home with excellent grades though). I was really extroverted, always laughed and made jokes, aced every test and barely had to study. Basically everyone wanted to be around me because I had such an uplifting aura and I really enjoyed hanging out with a large group of people and being in the centre of attention. But then everything changed for the worse so rapidly, I couldn't handle it. I was still doing fine at the beginning of 9th grade but I noticed how I increasingly lost motivation to do things and with that my grades went down the tubes.

My story isn't over yet, but I think I should tell you one of my hypotheses here because it might be the reason (a really stupid reason) why I became such an emotional wreck. I need to give you some background information though; so I've been into this Korean boy group for almost exactly three years now and I have to say that one of the members is probably the only reason why I haven't killed myself yet, even though he could have possibly triggered my depression. After my ""squad"" split up I felt really lonely and I needed something or someone who can give me some comfort and at that time I was already a pretty big fan of this group, but got more and more obsessed after time passed. It got out of control. My obsession with this goddamn man went so far that I started to skip school because I was so scared of missing out on something related to him, I had panic attacks and was extremely anxious when I wasn't able to check Twitter every second, my friends were terrified and stopped talking to me because I behaved so weirdly and on our school trip to Ireland I once burst out crying because I told myself over and over that I'm a horrible person for not keeping up with his daily life since I couldn't use my phone all the time. Of course there were so much more incidents but I won't bother you with all of them... let's just say it was an ""interesting"" experience. I'm sorry, you probably think I'm crazy, but maybe I really am and they should just let me perish in an asylum!

Sorry, I'm going to move on with my story. Now you know why I'm thinking that this could possibly be a reason for my dilemma even though I've never told anyone before because I'm too scared of people judging me. I guess this whole drama about my obsession drained me so much that I even lost my last bit of motivation to stay updated every day and since then it's been an up and down kind of thing. I'm still really dependent on this group/guy but it's not close to as bad as it used to be. Sadly back then I didn't know what else I had to do go through. You know, no one except my close friends knew about my obsession so it wasn't a big deal for me and I never thought about what impacts it could have on my life, so I just tried to erase it from my memories and it even worked for a while. But in 10th grade someone suddenly noticed that something's not right with me. I myself didn't notice how much I changed over summer break and the exact same thing happened this year again, but I just can't help it. So in 10th grade when I got my first 5 (worst mark in my country) on a the first math exam we had, my math teacher reached out to me and literally asked what's wrong with me these days since I've never failed one of her exams before. Of course I told her that everything's fine, but she didn't believe me at all and wanted to talk to me personally, so we arranged a meeting and she asked me some questions, I answered and I don't really know how to describe it, but I just loved to talk with her. She's one of the kindest and most understanding people I have ever met and I wish everyone could have someone like her in their life. When I'm around her I always get this sudden feeling of safety and comfort, it's so nice. Up until this day I still talk to her weekly (so this kind of ""relationship"" or bond, whatever you want to call it, has been going on for a very long time already) and I can't describe it in words how grateful I am that she realised how miserable I actually felt. She also talked to my mom several times about my problems and mental state, but since my mom doesn't really care about the way I feel, it was completely useless. She's still as ignorant as before when it comes to topics like this and I really hate her for that but you can't change someone's way of thinking this easily, so I just don't care anymore. I'm not even trying to explain things to her anymore because it will only end with me being yelled at or being kicked out of the house and feeling even worse than before our conversation. As you can probably tell, we don't have the best mother-daughter relationship, but I'm not complaining because if I was here, I would be overwhelmed with someone like me too. I mean, I actually am overwhelmed with myself... so yeah. I'm just glad I have my math teacher since I can tell her anything without feeling judged and we really do talk about everything and I'm actually convinced that I wouldn't be here anymore without her. One time I ran to her, looking like I've been crying for several days straight, the morning after my mom kicked me out and I told her that I wanted to die, and she didn't freak out or anything, she just tried to calm me down and let me see the aspects of life that she thought were worth living for.
This post is getting way too long to be honest, I'm really sorry for making you read so much (if you're still reading this sh*t) but I just feel the need to write all these things down. I'll try to summarise it a bit more now.
One thing that even made my mom realise that something's wrong with me is when I suddenly lost a significant amount of weight at the end of 10th grade which was this year. I looked like a skeleton fresh out of the grave with only 43kg but to be honest, I really liked the way I looked and I still do... I was forced to gain weight this summer though because everyone was scared I'm going to die (which was my goal in the first place). I still hate myself for gaining weight because if I kept starving myself, I would probably be dead by now. And now we have finally arrived at this part of my story, my current state.
My life is useless, it's not worth all this suffering day after day... I don't have an aim in life, I don't have any hobbies, I don't have any friends, I'm failing at school, I can't stand myself, I don't remember the last time I smiled or laughed and really meant it, I feel like an object, not like a human being. I'm failing at life! I'm the disgrace of our society! The only reason why I haven't killed myself yet is because I'm a fucking pussy! I'm still waiting for something terrible to happen that pushes me over the edge to get the remaining courage to finally be able to finish the job. I stay awake every goddamn night and make up scenarios in my head about killing myself and I know it's completely crazy, but I enjoy it. Knowing that I can end my life so easily calms me down in a sort of way. The truth is, I'm convinced that no one needs me. Most of the people around me ignore me already anyway, so why not grant them their wish? If there was a button that erases my entire existence from the memory of all the people who have ever gotten to know me, it would have been pressed by now. And it's unnecessary to tell me that it'll get better one day because I know that it won't. That's wishful thinking. I've been trying to get help for two years and I'm just getting worse and worse. Why should I keep suffering and enduring this constant, nearly unbearable emotional pain when I don't believe in having a future. I don't even believe that I'll make it until the end of 11th grade. I guess life just isn't for everyone. It wasn't my decision to be born in the first place. Saying I hate my life would be more than an understatement. Of course some people might be a bit sad if I I'm not here anymore but they'll get over it and keep on living their lives without me and in the end it'll be as if nothing has ever happened. What's so bad about not wanting to be a part of all this? We are humans, we're not immortal, we will all die sooner or later. So why not speed up the process for the sake of my ""sanity""? Life should be enjoyable but it's destroying me and I just can't bear it anymore. It's too much for me. I feel so empty but so much pain at the same time, it's unbelievable. I just can't keep living like this. It's so frustrating to wake up every morning and regret your entire existence. Sometimes you just have to accept the fact that there are people out there who don't think highly of this whole ""life is a gift"" drivel and you don't do them a favour by literally forcing them to stay alive. Some people, including me, are better off dead."

I've reached my limit time and time again no matter how far I've tried to ""extend"" it. I tried therapy for four years until it fell through, and despite my best efforts I haven't been able to find another one, plus they'd probably just force me into some institution which would only make things worse. And I still feel like this. I don't know what good posting this here is, perhaps it's just out of spite to all the people who have told me to keep trying, who have told me I'm worth it, who have told me there is anything worth living for, who have told me it gets better, and whatever nonsense people have tried telling me to convince me not to end it all. And I'm not even sorry. I hold nothing but contempt for everyone who has tried to help me. I don't care anymore if it's selfish, if it *will* get better, if it will hurt or even kill my family and friends. I can't take another day of this. I have no reason not to end it anymore"

I've been told I'm too young to think this and that everything will work out, but so far things seem to be getting worse and more out of hand. I get anxious at the thought of life after high school, and all I can think is that I don't really have a place in life, nor do I even want a place in life. 

So while my friends are busy doing whatever, I'm writing my goodbye notes to them instead of doing my homework. "
Chaoraiser256,5fm54w,1480462699,This might be goodbye.,"Hi there.

I'm not good with words at all but I'll try my best.

I've been suffering from depression for most of my life,getting worse as time goes on (also Autism,hate me all you want, I don't care anymore.)

My family sees me as a dissapointment and a failure,saying that I'm a disgrace as a person and that I should be ashamed of myself for turning out how I did,with desire to kick me out even,I have no job,no money, and nowhere to go, I have nothing.

I'm not on medication and the therapists and counselors I've talked to haven't helped me at all.

I had two friends that I loved to dearest to my heart but I'm about to lose them.(cause of my depression driving them away and them not wanting to be with me for the same reason.)

I frequently have anxiety attacks where I just start breaking down and crying for what appears as no reason. (One of those cost me my friends.)

Most people I know irl don't like me (a few even telling me to go kill myself)

I'm giving myself till sometime in December/January for things to be better but after that,if things don't then I'm done.

I've already tried to kill myself twice,might as well go for a third.

I already have an idea on how to do it (probably an exit bag,I've tried pills before but obviously those didn't work.)

To those that tried to help me, thank you so much and I'm sorry I'm such a failure that I can't beat this.

If my friends are reading this,then I'm sorry, I love ya'll with the bottom of my heart and I'm sorry I was such a worthless piece of trash,undeserving of any love that I drove you away.

Anyone want to talk to me right now,go right ahead I'll try to respond,I don't expect it though :(."

She has closed herself off to me emotionally and our marriage is falling apart.

My entire life has been absolute Hell, although I feel bad even saying that considering how others have it worse. My parents don't know how to parent. My other two siblings suffer from depression, and my brother is now a paranoid schizophrenic who my parents try to forget about. Anytime I cry or voice discomfort, I'm hit or told I'm a schizo failure. From age seven I've had plans of killing myself. I was bullied so severely in school that I'm afraid of people, not even the principle would help me even as I was assaulted by people. I had horrible trauma, but I took theatre for five years to force myself to pretend to be happy. Now I'm charismatic and appear normal irl and it's tearing me apart. Everytime I try to talk to someone they leave or tell me to just go to therapy. I want to be successful, and I tried hard at hobbies and remembering things but could never be as good as others even if I tried for hours. I found out recently that I have a learning disability that affects my memory, sense of direction and mathematical ability so I learn at slower rates than others. People consistently tell me I don't try hard enough, and if I complain or cry at all they assume I'm instantly crazy when I'm trying as hard as I can. I'm consistently called useless and oversensitive, and overall I just can't see anything good about the world. My parents are separated, my mother twice divorced, my step father a murderer and in jail now and my father married to some foreign woman who he knocked up. The only person I had was my brother, and now he doesn't even remember my name. I'm bitter. I have a loving boyfriend, but even though he cares about me he's not able to talk to me and I'm consistently told by others that I'm incapable of being helped. I have an internship with an amazing company and my future doesn't look dark, but with how ignorant people are I just can't see myself salvaging happiness from anything. I hate the world. I hate everything it has to offer. I want to live in the wilderness away from people and their disgusting amounts of apathy towards everyone else. Nobody ever helped me, not even when I was being abused and now they want to pretend like it never happened to make me shut up. Nobody, not even friends will listen to me.

I was a rather zealous believer. I've preached for Islam before. I've given up on the girls I fell in love with as zina is haram.
I've tried reasoning with my parents about why I no longer believe. They just told me to shut up and take it up on faith. I cannot have faith in something I know is false.

When I was 17 I started using cannabis to relieve my symptoms. After a while (when I was about 22) my family got fed up with me using cannabis and I was getting it from my brothers high school friend. So my family asked the drug dealer to lace my weed, he complied. The drug dealer got paranoid or something after lacing my weed and he thought I called the cops on him.

After that his gang made my parents poison me because he thought I snitched on him. I had been poisoned for about 8 months before I decided to confront my parents and ask them why they were doing it because at the time I didn't know why. I found out later when I was in jail. The symptoms of the poison being ingested were that my veins were hemorrhaging (that's what the doctor told me). I called the cops to tell them that my parents were poisoning me and one cop said they couldn't do anything because it was ""community food"".

My parents and I got into a fight and I ended up using a knife on them. The poison made me delusional so I didn't really know what I was doing or thinking of the consequences of my actions. So I ended up getting arrested and I was in jail for 15 months. I can't count on my two hands the number of people who wanted to kill me in jail because of that piece of shit drug dealer who thought I ratted him out.

So now most of my family won't even talk to me. My parents still talk to me and my grandma does too. But I don't have any friends and the girl I'm talking to seems to be uninterested in a relationship for whatever reason.

Anyway. I have no will to live. This world is beyond fucked because of greedy and selfish people and I want out."

He fucking mocked me and my 12 year old brother laughed. I saw he got honor roll for this school term. I have never brought in anything to make either parent proud. Even after graduation no one gave a fuck. I've tried to at least get acknowledged. I've tried doing creative things like writing, drawing, and learning an instrument. But no one fucking cares.

Yolostone,5cjez4,1478935144,"Some of my friends have been talking about ""killing themselves"" in a light-hearted manner. I'm not sure if they are joking.","I originally posted to r/relationships, but was advised to go here.

My current roommate and a few of our friends from high school are the people I'm worried about. I'll address each individually, and then talk about any group dynamics. 

Roommate (20, male): He comes from a loving family and I thought was enjoying a happy college life at a good university. As far as I know, he hasn't made any new friends since college, but maintains contact with high school friends, including the other two in concerned about. He drinks anywhere from 1-3 times a week, getting anywhere from tipsy to ""kill myself"" drunk (direct quote). Recently, he's been saying stuff like ""what's the point of living"" and ""contemplating killing myself"" when I've asked him what's wrong. His tone isn't super serious, but it's not just the casual ""I want to kill myself"" people throw out there. I may be overreacting to this one.

Note: The next two live in a different city. 

Friend A: (21 male) Also comes from a healthy family. He goes to a decent university, though I'm not sure if it is the one he wanted. He is in a fraternity, and I believe he has made a couple new friends. Most of the rest of the information I get through the above roommate, who communicated with him frequently (daily basis through text). He gets drunk most nights. He recently got out of a relationship and has been on a one-night stand spree. He's not too happy with his current situation, but I can't say I'm positive about him being  vocal about considering suicide.

Friend B: (19 male) His parents are divorced and from what I can tell, he doesn't have the best relationship with them. He got us attended a small, unknown college due to not getting accepted anywhere else. He was extremely unhappy with his life over the summer and beginning of the school year. After talking to roommate and Me, he deciding to try applying to colleges again so he can transfer. This seems to be helping him out, but I've asked him what's his plan for the next year if he doesn't get in anywhere else, and his response was: ""there won't be a next year.""

So we are all friends and have been since early high school. My roommate and Friend A apparently talk about suicide and suicide memes together, and how drinking solves their problems. Friend A and B frequently hang out to drink. 

I don't know how serious this is with respect to each one of them, but it's enough for me to be a little concerned. Should I take any steps, and if so, what should I do?

TL;DR: Have three friends that may be depressed to suicidal. I may be overreacting, but they are all heavy drinkers and are not super happy with their current place in life. "

Plus I have my own college life to attend to and am really busy, especially right now.

But I'm also worried because I don't think his support network is very strong. I'm one of his closest friends. He has other friends, but has also alienated quite a few people with unpopular opinions. He really dislikes his family.

I feel like he should get help from a trained psychologist or something, but he distrusts psychologists, especially the mental health resources at our college. I think he's heard and known too many bad interactions with them, probably the biggest of which was how they forcefully hospitalized and expelled one of his friends a few years back.

I don't know what to do."
mythrowaway135792468,5c6k6m,1478761437,"I constantly have thoughts of killing myself, but I don't actually want to do it.","This is going to be a long post, as I am forcing myself to make it after having these thoughts build up over time.

I will start this post off with some background information about myself as to help those reading understand.

- I am a 14 year old white male.

- I have two younger brothers.

- I go to a private high school, and it is causing my parents financial problems.

- I have not been diagnosed for any mental health issues.

- I live in the USA.

Almost every day for about the last year and a half I have had constant and endless thoughts on why I should just end it. I am just going to start listing(and boy is it a big list) because if I did not write these down somewhere I think my head would explode.

**Disappointment to my parents:**

This is a big one. Being in a private school is the first thing, as it puts large financial constraints on my family and occasionally causes my parents to argue. My mom never got anything under a B on any assignment until she was in college. I am floating around with C's and D's. More on school later.

It's not like my parents are bad, it's me that's the problem. My parents are always supportive of me and have tried to help me through school. They love me, and this is very obvious from how they act towards me. I care how they see me, but perhaps only because that is what is expected. Honestly, I don't really feel that same unconditional love towards them, I just feel like I have to live up to their expectations. In fact, I don't really feel super close to either of my parents.

As a quick sub point: I do dance.

I am not very good.

My mom, the owner of the dance studio I go to would be crushed if I quit.

I really want to quit.

**School:**

So. School. The thing I should be doing work on as I type. I don't do my work. I don't study for tests. It's not that it's a problem with learning the concepts, I love learning when it comes to things that interest me. I hate doing anything I don't like for work. It's not like I haven't tried before. I can go days with perfect marks in school, then I stop trying. I give up. I always want to do something else. I stare at my screen and I don't do my work. Anything but doing work. My teachers approach me to ask what the problem is and I just have to say I am not doing my work. I do anything to not do it, or I do it minutes before it's due. I can't stay focused on my work. I think this might be because I have undiagnosed ADD or ADHD, but I can't tell my parents because they have said negative things to me when I have been around with friends that have high levels of ADHD, even if I was their only friend, and they were mine. I have had my parents(actually just my mom) tell me I should not hang out with these kids. I am too afraid to tell them I think i might have a disorder when it comes to attention.

**Problems socially:**

I have problems about feeling like I need everyone to like me. Whenever I am around someone I follow what they say because I do not want them to be against me. I have maybe one very close friend I can be myself with, and even sometimes I do not want to start an argument with him. I hate this about myself.

Besides this I lie. Like I lie a lot. I lie to my parents, teachers, some of my friends, and anyone else. I lie to strangers on reddit to get them to like me. ~~I have actually gone though revisions to get rid of lies in this thread.~~ That was a lie. I went through thoughts about thing I would say in the thread that would have been lies. I was going to say I already attempted to overdose when I didn't. It's a problem. And it is constant.

**Overshadowed by my younger brother:**

One of my brothers is 12 years old.

He has it all.

He is working with different companies across the country in musical theater companies PROFESSIONALLY.

He was second in the country in a dance competition, and that was with a broken fucking foot. And then he cried that he didn't get first.

He was on the California boy's gymnastics level 6 all star team.

He has plans to go on Broadway, then be in Hollywood Films.

He is a straight A student.

He is better than me in every way.

**Don't know what to do with my life, no drive to do things, and not good at the things I like.**

I have no idea what I want to do with my life.

I enjoy:

-Solving Rubik's cubes

-Playing video games

-Doing art

-Recording myself read stories, or record myself making voices to portray a character

Here's the thing: I suck at all of them.

**The last thing:**

I am too afraid to tell anyone any of these things. I am too afraid people will look down on me and treat me different if I attempt to get help. This REALLY makes me want to just end it. I would rather be dead than spend a life being depressed and useless.

Sometimes I am hanging on by a thread. A reddit post that made me laugh. A youtube video I enjoyed. The fact I want to see that next episode of that anime I am watching.

Also, I would rather not be depressed, and would rather not kill myself. I still have these thoughts though. It consumes me. All I can feel is how useless and stupid I am. And if I am just going to be depressed, than fuck living. I only want to live if I can be happy. I haven't really been happy in years. Help me.

I am not that person, and don't think I ever have been. I've struggled with depression and ADD for years, issues which historically have disbarred doctors from practice (like literally, having depression resulted in docs not getting the licenses renewed). I love working out and used to teach group fitness classes, but I have a good extra 20 lbs on me (I stress eat). And as a 5'10"" girl with a good dose of gender confusion, I'm not girly enough to have men swoon over me. I'm also not butch enough to have women swoon over me. I like nerdy shows/books and Pokemon and love science, but am surrounded by people who seem totally underwhelmed by how cool the stuff we're learning is. I'm never able to drag my ass out of bed on-time, and am always 2 minutes late to everything (assuming I don't sleep through it and have to fake illness).

Everyone here is so beautiful, and stylish, and mature, and I'm wearing old raggedy nerd shirts and shoes that I've had since high school. Everyone is so skinny, and seems to not believe that I ever taught group fitness classes. Everyone is so smart, and seems to not believe that I went to an extremely competitive undergrad and then an even more competitive masters. I survived some horrendously challenging academic, personal, and fitness challenges, but have to reassure them that I did (""Yea, no I definitely got a masters in biochemistry, I'm not kidding"". I try to not talk about the crazy cool things I've done because I'm not an asshole who tries to humble-brag 24-7, but as a result people treat me like I'm invisible.

Maybe they're right. Maybe my masters doesn't mean shit. maybe the fact that i've done crazy endurance events doesn't mean shit, maybe the fact that some people used to think I'm good-looking doesn't mean shit here. It feels like the bar was raised, and though I totally exceeded it in more competitive places, here I'd have to be even prettier/cockier to get recognition. I feel like I'm just in everyone's way. 

With 7 billion people on this planet, the cynic in me thinks that the planet might be better off if some of us suicidals just went ahead and did it. The girls here are so goddamn girly, the guys here are so goddamn stylish, I'm not good enough to date anyone here. I'm not arrogant enough/ enough of a narcissist to know that I'm the shit no matter how many people tell me I'm not. How will I survive residents and attending telling me flat-out that I'm crap if I can't even deal with this subliminal/ covert treating me like shit from my peers???"

It's been two years and I've withdrawn, emotionally killing everything and everyone around me until I have become extremely paranoid, anxious, depressed all the time. For two years. I have wasted two years of my life in anxiety. I feel like a complete fucking moron. I don't think I can stand up against my father, would have to go no contact to start all over by myself. I can't decide if I should stay here and get a free college education with no trust for everything around me, or get a job and go to a cheap college later. I have no idea who I am. I keep telling myself to get the fuck over it and hang out with people and melt into this place. But something stops me, probably teenage rebellion shit which I haven't had before, and complete fear paralysis. I've never had a close friend, not in high or middle school. Just wanted to take care of my dad and let him manipulate me. It was so much easier than facing anxiety and seeing people as 'real' with 'empathy'. I'm terrified of people, no idea what they think. 

This school is so small I am reminded of all my past behavior and idiocy every. single. day. What's worse is that I avoided people because I thought they were out to get me. Then over these two years, everyone KNOWS that I've completely shut down, but ignore it or talk about it with each other later (I have evidence for this, professors I don't know stare at me for a long time etc) So it's validated the idea that no one has empathy, just all in self-interest, can't give a shit about someone who is just struggling and 'eccentric'. I feel like this is my last throe before just killing myself, where you shake around before you stop breathing. I feel like I don't have anything in common with anyone I interact with. I'm slowly turning into a paranoid narcissist (exactly like my father, which is why I had to take care of his antics 24/7, but I'm BECOMING THAT) and I genuinely find myself revolting. I have no idea what kind of job I could do after college. Everything is a surreal, paranoid, angry blur and I have no idea where to go. Or trust myself. A free college educ is a good thing. And it's all in my head. I just need to GET THE FUCK OVER IT. And appreciate these tons of opportunities. And I'm scared that the rest of the world is like this. Judgmental and non-empathetic. I feel like I'm already floating away. Feel like not a real person, at all. Disconnected from everything. "
hope_is_an_illusion,5etp9y,1480082644,So what is the point of life?,"Honestly, this post is not about me wanting to commit suicide. I am not there emotionally yet, just not ready yet, you can say. 

However, thoughts about suicide often cross my mind. Not that I actually want to die when they hit me, nope. But I just start thinking it over - what's the point in life if I can't set myself a firm goal? if I can't possibly decide what is best for me, if i can't possibly decide what job in this world will make me get up in the morning feeling happiness, or at least with a smile, while my family and others are waiting for some substantial changes in my life (like me finally showing them I am a proper adult)? if I can't motivate myself doing anything (sometimes anything AT ALL) properly, much less create some action plan towards a future goal? if I can't communicate with people properly because I am so much of an introvert (I have no friends and never had any, just some people I knew well in school, college, etc.)? if I see absolutely no future for myself, I mean, how can I possibly see any future if I can't set up goals and can't motivate myself improving my own life? 

These moments I feel like a wreck and so I question myself - what's actually the point of life? May be life is just moo much of a responsibility to me, the one I can't handle? And even if I choose to die, why the hell should I bother who will cry after this? I mean, I will be dead, right? I won't give a single damn about the living anymore. So why should I think about those who will cry after I die, why, even on the verge of suicide should I think about other people? This is my life, my choice, right? 

There is no point in life, this is all I derived for myself philosophically (I ain't dumb I suppose overall). Shit, even Solomon said this in the Bible (Ecclesiastes, but I am NOT religious at all). There are people who don't know this (probably too busy to think about shit like this, or may be not smart enough to understand it), people who do know this truth, but who keep drinking/drugging themselves to avoid thinking of it, and there are people who take action - who kill themselves, logically doing the only right thing.

So the question is - what on earth should actually prevent me from blowing my brains out if things get too hard (I am almost 100% sure that in the nearest 3-4 months they will)?

Sorry for the long post, but this is actually the only thing that bothers me now, and has been for almost a year now."
chbe101,5d5ybd,1479253505,Ready to give up,"I'm a junior in college and completely miserable. I had depression and anxiety since high school. My parents never understood my problems and are helicopter/tiger parents. I've been through therapy, medication, and recently I went to one of the best mental hospitals in my state with no luck. I used to be such an ambitious person that did really well in school, and now I'm failing all of my courses with no motivation to continue. I'm in a major chosen by my parents that I hate and don't feel motivated to start all over again. I have no friends and all my other resources (therapists/psychiatrists) are incredibly booked for me to get an appointment soon. I want to withdraw from school, but I don't know what I'll do, especially if I have to go live with my parents. I hate everything about myself and my life and can't picture myself getting better in the future. So many people have told me almost every year that it gets better, but it's only gotten worse for me. I don't know if I want to live with depression/anxiety anymore, especially having no one to talk to. The only reason I haven't attempted suicide yet is because I'm too scared for it to fail. Just don't know what to do anymore"

Message7932,5fjhv9,1480436200,Sick of everything,"Past 5 years I have had pretty bad depression but its been neglected by my parents so nothing was done about well now its catching up. All I ever think about is some way to kill myself. In a car I could just open the door and fall out and just end it right there that would be crazy how would the media react to some kid on the highway jumping out of the car. Oh he had such a nice life his family loved him he had friends how did this happen. Just random stupid shit like that. I'm so done with all of this life is a horrible place. What is the meaning of life honestly make connections with people have experiences live life the way you want to. Fuck all that here I am staying over night doing school work still failing I'm a fucking loser. The only reason I havent killed myself is that I don't want to destroy my girlfriend. I just turned 20 and she made a great birthday for me and im too fucked up to show emotions that I had to explain how happy I was just so she wouldnt think I didnt like it. Fuck this I don't want to live like this. Cant afford a shrink. My job is even more fucked, I get bullied and blamed for shit because I'm goofy. Fuck no one even knows how deeply fucked up I am because I always joke around. Tell me where to go from here because all i see is an empty piece of shit"

TheMightyBattleSquid,5alced,1478030605,I'm concerned about myself but not sure if I should tell someone irl,"I've developed a habit of thinking ""I want to die"" when life is putting me in its vice grip. I think it over and over. I haven't had actual thoughts of suicide, just this overwhelming thought about how I wish *something* would put me out of my misery. I try to remind myself that there are other less drastic ways to ""end"" my problems and that I can always work my way back to whatever I'm committing time to worrying about but this recurring thought is always the first response these days and lasts a full 20-30 minutes initially. Given the less than stellar responses from those around me to my depression I'm not feeling confident enough to tell anyone I know. I've been thinking it over and over but I only just now felt up to making this post. I don't want to kill myself yet, I want to ""quit"" living, but it's honestly just semantics when I boil it down and I'm scared something could push my over that edge."

guitarguy1326,5c3nou,1478724941,I feel stuck,"I hate asking people for advice about this kinda stuff, but I don't think I have another choice. I've had crippling depression for as long as I can remember. Last year, I had a psychotic break which forced me to withdraw from classes, come home and take a semester off. Lately, I've been seeing a resurgence of these psychotic symptoms. Nothing major yet, just voices in my head now and then and some other weird auditory hallucinations. I feel like I can't tell my parents about this, because I know how disappointed and how sad it would make them. Beyond that, I've been experiencing multiple panic attacks a day, often so severe that I feel I am going to die. I really don't think college is a place for me, I never wanted to be here in the first place but I agreed to come in order to appease my mom. At this point, I feel like I have completely failed in every aspect of life. I know I can't make my parents proud, I can't do anything right. At this point, I see only one option. I'm not real enthusiastic about it, and I can't say I'm planning on it as of right now, but the option of suicide has been in my head every day since I was 13 and I'm starting to consider it more seriously now. I really want a way out of this that doesn't involve something so drastic, but I don't see another choice."

whutchadoin,5b2c7i,1478245681,The pendulum is swinging out of control,"I have a interview for a new job tomorrow, one that may help my financial as well as my mental health. As I'm trying to sleep, the thoughts of my best friend creep in. The one that I fell in love with. The one I told. The one that says she wants us to move past this and stay friends. The one that has been pushing me out of her life. Then the tears come. And the thoughts of suicide come with it. I have had days where I feel ok. But it's the nights that terrorize me.  I haven't been in a social gathering with friends in months. Only at meetings. I've been so fucking lonely that I want to hang myself, the last attempt failed though. I have knives and insulin so I could do it and no one would find me for days, but the fear of death keeps my away from it. Yet in the quiet moments I pray for it. I'm afraid that I am losing what little sanity I had. As I write this, the interview is in 7 hours. I should've been asleep 2 hours ago. Yet my diseased mind keeps swinging my emotions from hopeful to hateful with stops at every nuanced feeling inbetween. Why did I pour my heart in these people? They see I'm going under and they won't extend their hand to me. I broke myself helping them, broke my heart. Now I need help putting it back together and no one is there. Why shouldn't I have the choice to end this life? Why do I have to continue to suffer? "
mrkittywieners,5cifxu,1478918166,Here's me venting,"I'm a teenager enrolled in his junior year of high school, and I often contemplate suicide.  It's not that I have a problem with popularity,  I feel my status in that department is up to par. I just never felt an actual connection to anyone,  not even my girlfriend of two years. Sex is monotonous already.  I've grown to see myself less as a person and more of an observer for other people. I resent everyone around me, except for my family. I know they care about me but I don't about myself.  My deadly sin is sloth.  No matter how much I research how to break it I end up ruining my life with procrastination. That's another thing.  Other kids. I think on a different plane than them. I have a constant need for knowledge and justice.  This is evident by my obsession with learning world politics. There kids don't care.  They see a headline on facebook and accept it as fact.  On top of all that is this girl. She's the only one I've ever felt to challenge me intellectually. I don't love her,  not a bit. But I'm still obsessed. My grades are trash, my view of the world is trash,  and my mind is caving in.  Suicide seems to be the only answer that will end the sleep paralysis/ pounding feeling in my chest. I just want to know even though I have horrible grades,  little chance of passing high school,  and no motivation to change it,  what do?"
throwawayPos49,5bqe4x,1478569192,22 depressed and hiv positive,"From around 13 I've always questioned life.

Now I'm 22 and questioning it more than ever.

I'm depressed and unhappy with life.

I have a girlfriend that lives with me at my parents house who I don't think I'm in love with anymore. So it's kind of annoying her being there and having no space for myself.
Also I'm scared if I leave her I won't find another partner accepting of my hiv.

We haven't had sex in weeks. I just have no desire to, which is awfully weird.

I dropped out of school, have a lousy minimum wage job with an asshole for a manger and in debt. (Not that much)

I binge drink and smoke everyday for an artificial ""happy time"" but that only last a couple of hours before I come down.

The last 9 years of my life has been unhappy. I feel like it's not going to change and living for 20+ years unhappy is just torturing myself.

Is it worth it with the struggle later down the road with health problems and it being hard to find a significant other.


Any advice?? 



"
tamedimpalalg,5ercvr,1480042235,I guess im just looking to put this stuff down so someone can see it.,"Hello all, this is a newly made account because well, cant have people who know my main account seeing this stuff.  

But I am 17, turning 18 this February. I have not been officially diagnosed with anything due to my fucking awful parents. More on that later.  
But I think that for once in my life I think im allowed to feel my own feelings. I just want to write down this stuff so someone sees it, I need feedback and some sort of human response.  

What has urged me to post this is that moments ago, I just sat back in my chair and my mind thought over suicide for one of the many hundred times its happened this month. Usually I just dismiss it, think of your friends! Think of your non-shitty family members, they would miss you. Think of all the stuff you wont experience.  
But no, this time I just thought. ""Wow, id be gone and be left with no hard feelings. I would be free."" And I smiled, laughed and just reveled in the idea of just not existing.  


But why am I thinking like this? Well it's really just a bunch of things, ranging from personal issues, family issues, work issues.    
  
I have been known to self harm, I believe about 2 summers ago my mom saw the underside of my arm. I had rows and rows of deep cuts along it I had done earlier that day in the shower. My mom seemed worried, acted worried. ""What would have happened if you cut an artery and bled to death? Is that what you want? Do we need to see a shrink?"" Ugh ""Shrink"" thanks, mom. She eventually settled on ""I wont tell your father if you promise not to do it again."" the one person who'd actually get me real help and be genuinly concerned, she knew I wouldnt tell him on my own and wouldnt speak against her on it. See my mom likes to act like any negative thing I feel is my fault. Her reasoning was that im bored and need to get out more. I need to get a job so I wont have the time to do this. I've been to /r/raisedbynarcissists too, but eh, I dont know I dont think its much help. Anyways, her little fucking stunt of ""dont do it again and it will be okay :)"" just made me move the cuts onto my upper arm, where a normal shirt covers them. They have gotten deeper too, mom, and these scars that look brand new have really been there for half a year.  
And would you believe it, this year in an attempt to get me to carve pumpkins for halloween, and I quote this nearly word for word.  
""Well you know, you like cutting things with razors so maybe you can use your fascination of cutting things to make a cool design! :)""  I just gave her an angry glare and left for work, this was the first time any self harm talk had happened in a year and she looked at me like im the one who is crazy.  

Another thing that bothers me is my gender dysphoria. I am biologically male, I have gone through many stages of ""what the hell is happening"" and maybe due to me still being in my teen years. But from ages 13-16 I thought I was gay, but then I thought I liked more than just guys so I thought of myself as pansexual/bi. But then I just stopped really feeling like a boy, I feel like a girl more often than not. My feelings on the matter change so rapidly between ""am I a guy or a girl?"" I just dont know anymore. I feel so lost on this and im ashamed of it. Why can't I just be happy the way I was born? Who am I to want to change the way I am like this. It is one big mess that just fucks with my head and never leaves me alone. I feel ashamed doing or enjoying guy things, or doing and enjoying girl things.  

Onto another source of feelings of taking my own life. Is my job, it's a shitty understaffed fast food place. It has made me really just hate people. I hate the people I work with, the people I work for, the customers I hate. I currently only work friday - sunday so yeah maybe im just a shithead highschooler who has bad work ethic. I think that if I worry myself to the thought of killing myself to get out of work the week leading up to the days I am scheduled. It goes beyond having shitty work ethic, it's more of a shitty will to live I guess. I started working a couple months after turning 16, I quit earlier in the year, parents scolded me and gave me shit for it. It was the one place I knew I could get a job at easily and so I was rehired. I despise it more now than I did before. I know if I quit again, my parents would get even more angry with me and the thought of the worthless shitheads that work there talking behind my back just fucks with me. I know they would talk behind my back because they do it to other employees daily.  

It's just my mind is constantly being fucked with, I am anxious of the future, scared to speak to anyone who can truly get me to the help I need. I am paranoid of completely trivial and stupid things. If I am lucky I dont feel some sort of creeping dread for 30 minutes once a month. Literally other than that im always scared of tomorrow, scared of later today, scared of the end of the week. My parents wonder why I dont talk to them. My answer to 90% of things is ""I don't know."" because I just fucking dont know. I dont know who I am, what I am, what I want to do, what im going to do. All I know is that im slowly losing control of myself and that now that my mind doesnt immediatly dismiss suicide it instead has me smiling and laughing at the thought of just not existing. That eventually I physically wont be able to hold myself back from doing it when it gets to that. It's just getting worse and worse.  

Thanks all, to everyone who bothered.

throwaway109how,5ffe1y,1480378880,I'm a terrible person,"This weekend I kissed a girl and cheated on my girlfriend of three years. I've never loved my girlfriend more than I do now and have never been happier. I was blackout drunk and only really remember the immense guilt and remourse and knowing I did it. I told my girlfriend straight away the next morning and she's angry but loves me too much and wants to stay together. 

I can't forgive myself though. I can't look at myself in the mirror. I can't stand what I did. I don't understand it and it makes me sick. People keep telling me not to pity myself but I don't pity myself I detest myself. I detest what I did to the girl I truly truly love. I had written a post but deleted it and now feel worse but different. I can't think of anything but wanting to die. I haven't gone into work and won't tomorrow because all I want to do is die. I'm trying to just keep myself away from everything. I detest who I am. I am half the person I was and I have never felt more dead inside. The only thing that stops me killing myself is he knowledge my girlfriend still loves me but its killing me even more. Who should love me. I have nlbkdy reddit.

Whooooo I really wanna fucking die. (see, didn't I tell you I was going to swear?) If you can't already tell, I used to be a pretty humorous dude before what went down tonight. I'm 17 and I live in southern California, if that's relevant. I'm finishing up my last year of high school and damn is it stressful. I know I know, ""Every high schooler goes through depression, etc., you're fine, etc."" Uhh, paragraph break?

To try and understand where I'm coming from, I invite you to get into my headspace. Upon entry, you may think, ""Wow! What a shitstorm!"" That's what I feel every time I examine myself. So let's go over what's on my plate (the tangible stuff at least, I'll probably get to the other stuff later): I've got college apps (what a nightmare), a bunch of projects coming up due (yeah not a biggie), and oh so much homework. So much, in fact, that aside from meals, I'm doing school-related work non-stop. Sound miserable? You bet it is.

So I'd say for the past five months now, I've been bearing it. To get from class to class, I have my longboard that I ride, which provides some catharsis. Not nearly enough, but some. I'm fairly smart (I'd like to think), and people at my school often try to take advantage of that by copying, asking for advice, etc. While I try not to let it get to me, it inevitably does. If I'm sounding a little arrogant, sorry. But school is fairly stressful. 

Oh boy my home life! Backpedal 17 years to my dad really pissing my mom off, leading to divorce. For as long as I've been alive, I've lived back and forth between my mom and my dad. I visited my dad and live with my mom. Oh, I'm asian american, should probably mention that. Mom's asian, Dad's white. Of course there's kind of a disconnect from ""Chinese tradition"" and the ""American way,"" which I guess to this day befuddles me. What am I? But that's not the point.

To say my mom is abusive would be an overstatement. Not an outrageous overstatement, but a mild overstatement. When I was a child, spanking was often the most prominent form of discipline, and I remember one time getting spanked with a wooden coat hangar to the point where it broke. That wasn't a fun day. Once I got bigger than her (she's 5' tall) she laid off the physical torment and evolved to something far more devastating: emotional torment.

Constantly, for the past 5-6 years, I've been bombarded by her negative, discouraging comments, discouraging being an understatement. Basically, she mean. Sure, I'm a pretty unmotivated piece of meat, but I'm on track to be an aerospace engineer, so I'm not *that* useless. 

Okay reader, you've gotten enough exposition, I'm going to give you the juiciest thing so far: what tomorrow was going to look like! Tomorrow was supposed to be a great day! (It probably still will be, highly doubt I'll blow my brains out tonight.)(Christ I sound emotionally unstable when I say that; when I say that, it's more of a calculated decision. Other than the example you're going to hear later in the story, I rarely do things out of passion; I usually have strong reasoning)(*usually*) Okay, so tomorrow, there's this girl that I've been lusting after for a few months. We went on a date (not officially a date, but we both knew it was a date) last week and tomorrow, I planned to ask her out. For realsies. If last week was any indication, her answer would have been yes. That was what I was looking forward to.

inb4 someone claims it's girl related, it isn't. That's actually one of the reasons I'm still alive, that girl really is amazing. 

So tonight. 11pm. I wrap up my homework just as my mom comes into the living room. She gets irritated with me that I've stayed up ""late"" and didn't plan my day well, but nothing that fazed (sp?) me. She then points to the Lego Mindstorms on the fireplace that she bought for me this past summer. It sat, unfinished, collecting dust. I had been planning to work on it when all of my college apps were done, but that wasn't good enough for her. She felt like she wasted her money. For those that don't know, mindstorms is like lego robotics. It's quite pricey. Quite. She started saying that if I'm going to be that uncommitted she'll just sell it. This frustrated me because I want to do it, but I've just got no time.

Paragraph break cause I moved rooms. After telling her that she can't sell it and that I'll work on it, I go to my bedroom, quite angry but nothing too bad. I go to her bedroom to attempt to make amends and say goodnight, but she asks me if I brushed my teeth. I hadn't. I'm a fairly vain person, so neglecting hygiene isn't something I normally do. She said I forget to do it a lot. I challenged her to name the last time I forgot. She said that if she found it, I'd owe her money.

MAN, does she know how to push my buttons! I've been unemployed for the past month, so money's quite tight (no allowance from her, dad isn't in a position to give me anything). This infuriates me. Gah! Frustrating! So I do something insanely stupid.

No, I didn't punch her. God did I want to, but I didn't. I did happen to storm off to my room and make a sizeable dent in my closet door though....d'oh! I regretted it the second I did it. ""WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO?"" when she heard the sound. She stormed in and saw the damage, and said some pretty hurtful stuff. ""You're not my son, you animal!"" ""I don't know you!"" ""Get out of my house I don't want to see you ever again!"" Those are just a few choice words.

So after talking to her for 20 or so minutes, I've convinced her to let me stay. I need to repair the door, and holy balls does it cost alot ($250 USD + installation)(money I *don't* have), but otherwise the penalty is quite light. I'm sure I'll have to face my dad about it tomorrow morning, so that'll dampen my mood, but overall it's recoverable (with a lot of money, I'll probably have to sell my xbox).

But I really hate my existence. I really loathe it. I understand that I'll get to college and get out of this hell-hole of a home (even though I'm aware people have it way worse. I know, don't worry), but it's a goal that feels infinitely far away. I don't feel like I'm making progress in life. I'm really not terribly happy overall. I kind of just want it to end. It's miserable. It's been this way for a while now.

Seriously, bless you if you read this whole thing. My main reddit acct has around 5k Karma, so I'm aware of how awesome the reddit community can be. Let me know how I can cope with this and find a reason to live. Thanks.

Cheers."

My girlfriend is unattracted and doesn't care about me, and I know I could never find anyone else. I have no future where I'll ever be truly happy, or even successful at all. I'm an asshole to all my friends. I feel nothing even as I'm typing this. No emotion what so ever. No regret or sadness or relieve or anything. But I know that some people will be sad maybe when I pass. It doesn't even matter what people say to me in the next 4 days, I just have no will or want to care anymore. I'm trying to make my passing easier for them by being as mean as possible. I don't want them to be sad when I'm gone. I don't know if I can break up with my girlfriend though. I really don't want anyone to be sad. I want them to be happy maybe even. I know some of them already will be. Ive gotten so angry before and just lashed out at them. I'm so angry that if I don't kill myself I'll kill someone else. If im mean until the 10th, then I pass should I leave a note explaining why I was so mean. I guess they deserve to know. But once they know they'll be sad again. I guess I won't. It doesn't matter. Nothing matters anymore. I guess what matters now is what I do on the 10th. Life just isn't worth it. Theres nothing to make it worthwhile in my reach. Or anywhere. I don't know why I should even bother posting this anymore. I answered my own question. It was the should I leave a note behind one. But even that's pointless now. I guess I'm just mumbling in a way. Just putting my last few hundred thoughts on paper. I hope I'm not stalling. I don't want to stall on the 10th.

He beat me to the point of giving me a severe concussion, bruises all over my body, and complete hearing loss in one ear. I don't think I can live without him.   I'm afraid that if i kill myself though, people will go after him. He's already been completely ostracized from our school (it's very small) because of how he treated me. I'm a very popular guy with a lot of influence and I hate that I've ruined his reputation. Another huge concern is that there's a freshman boy, he's like a little brother to me. He tells me all the time that he idolizes me and looks up to me and I hate that i'm going to disappoint him. I don't want him to be angry with me. I don't know anymore.

CheapAssProps,5ahwdc,1477986755,I don't know who to reach out to.,"I don't feel comfortable reaching out to any of my friends for help.

My closest group doesn't talk to me or invite me to anything anymore. It's really, really disheartening to see them all update their social media, tagging each other, but realizing they made no contact with you. One reason could be that I hinted to one girl that I developed an emotional attachment to her, so she took that cue to ignore me-&gt;they all side with her. She was only introduced to us a few months ago, whereas the rest of us had acquainted years ago.

I only have this one friend that I talk to on a semi-frequent basis. But he's more of a ""bro"" kind of friend. Not someone I would show emotion to.

My family is all but dis attached from my life. They don't know anything that I do.

Years ago, I used to drive to HS along this narrow 2-lane road. And for a few weeks, I would go as close as I could, sometimes over, the solid line. Praying that someone not paying attention would hit me. I tried 3x-5x dosage of allergy medication, but that didn't really do anything.

darkpassenger54321,5fh713,1480401535,Don't give up. Don't ever give up.,"Eight months ago I was extremely depressed.  I felt completely hopeless.  Dealing with anxiety and depression for over 30 years had worn me down to the point where I became convinced that the only way that I could escape the mental anguish was through suicide.  I had access to a gun and was prepared to use it to end my life.

I do not know what prompted me to visit SuicideWatch for the first time that day.  As I browsed through the posts, I was surprised how compassionate and supportive the community members were.  The kindness that they shared with total strangers provided me with the motivation that I needed to reach out and call the Suicide Prevention Lifeline 800-273-8255.  

I wanted to come back and express my gratitude to all of you.  You are a large part of the reason that I am still here and have had the privilege of experiencing the last eight months.  Has it been perfect?  Certainly not, I have had my share of good and bad.  But the most important thing is that I am still here doing my best each day to manage my mental illness and be the best version of myself that I can be.

It is my sincere hope that one day I am able to help someone as much as you have helped me."

I've never seen her so happy and radiant then the next day it went right back to normal. I just can't go on feeling like this and I want to just go to a bridge and take the leap. I don't want to go on anymore. Everything sucks besides that one day and I keep sabotaging everything with my wife and by extension my family.

I actually did attempt suicide(again) and as you can see,I'm still here.How worthless can one actually be?
Anyways,I won't be getting treatment,as I've already been in therapy(which only made my life worse when others heard about it),and the therapist thinks I'm perfectly fine,but that's what everyone thinks,so it doesn't really matter.

callmecorvo,5c9w9q,1478807264,Farewell letter,"    Hello Today I want to tell you my story ,  My name Is Tazo from the Republic of Georgia, I want to share my story but sadly I have no one,  so I’m using the internet. I am currently 17 years old , hitting 18 in nearly 2 months and for the past 4 years I went through a lot. 

   4 years ago I had a disease , a quite severe one , I was hospitalized for 1 year , I was so weak I couldn’t even walk so we(My parents and I)went to Germany to get treatment , I was there for  nearly half an year)  and was ‘’cured’’ but the disease had left me extremely fat I was 174Cm tall(5’7) and weighted 115 kilos(255 pounds) , Because of my disease I had left school and was home-schooled,  in my free time I used to play video games so my weight didn’t bother me much , I didn’t have any friends to go out with so I was always alone at home. 
  One day I met a girl on social network , she was astonishingly beautiful , smart , and cute,  if love at first sight actually exists this was probably it , I started chatting with her getting to know her , of course she treated me like shit so I decided to change I started working out. She was my motivation  and thinking about her kept me moving , in the end I did lose 50% of my total weight.

Photo of me before I started working out: http://imgur.com/a/V5nn2 174Cm 115Kgs (5’7foot 255 pounds)

I was slowly getting in shape , I got some compliments here and there , met all kinds of people ( used to go to a lot of events) used to date many girls (thought I was a playboy because of it) I was pretty proud,  my body was improving I was getting thin and in my head losing weight = Being happy. You probably remember the girl I mentioned above , she still didn’t give me any attention so I decided to forget her. 
I was trying to find a substitute for her but sadly in vein. 
Time passed at this point I already had a lot of ‘’friends’’ I was quite popular I was in an amazing shape I grew in height I was 178(5’9’) and 60Kilos(132 pounds) , On one Halloween night I went out on a party ,  What a crazy night I drank a lot and took my shirt off,  girls went crazy they were all touching and kissing me(on my body and neck) , I felt like I was a god walking on the earth and at the end of the night one of my friends made out with me (this was my first kiss) and I offered her to be in a relationship with me to what  she agreed and said she had liked me for a long time already , and this is how I met my first girlfriend. 
  One month passed , eventually  she broke up with me , I was a inexperienced in a relationship and didn’t know how to act , it was probably my fault can’t blame her , In two days after the breakup she was making out with some dude , but I didn’t worry much and I moved on , everything was going quite well until…

Photo of me at that time: http://imgur.com/a/JKOQh 178CM 60Kgs (5’9Foot 132 pounds)
  My parents started critiquing me for being ‘’too thin’’ that It was unhealthy , a man should not look like this and that I had to gain weight this was devastating for me I had horrible depression I didn’t want to gain weight I felt perfect but they insisted , I started to self-harm , cry a lot when they were asleep , felt like I was being torn apart , but in the end because of the immense pressure I was put by my parents I was persuaded , and I agreed that I would gain weight if they would let me go to the gym (They didn’t allow me to go to the gym because it would ‘’stun my growth’’ ,  I only got thin and built muscle by working out at home)  They said yes but not until I would gain 8 kilos(5 pounds) of fat , so they basically force fed me cakes and food like that. After I gained fat and looked like shit they finally let me go to the gym. 
 Nothing of grave importance had happened in 7-8 months except for me gaining a lot of muscle mass and starting to look jacked , I was generally quite happy with my life I everything was going great when summer was nearly arriving I met my second girlfriend who I treated horribly because I didn’t like her visually , even though she tried her best I didn’t give her attention and she broke up with me (I basically made her do it because I was way too childish to break up with her myself).

Picture of me at my jacked state: http://imgur.com/a/XGOkz
 In The middle of the summer I met my last  girlfriend , two of my friend introduced me to her , it was visible that we both liked each other and in one week we were together(Kinda childish and foolish to get in a relationship with a girl you know for one week huh?)  , everything was more than perfect , we were even planning our future,  I did my best so did she, But sadly she had to part away out of the country for one  month , but we said this would not stop us and that we would continue loving each other and would stay in touch. 
  Not being able to see her was a torture I used to talk to her on phone for hours , it somehow made us even closer because we got to know each other even better  , we had no physical contact only our minds and ideas could interact , But after 1 month she broke up with me for absolute no reason , one week before the breakup she started treating me like shit , I knew what was coming sadly.
 The break up left me devastated, I horrible depression, somehow I realized that I had no one in my life , all my friends had moved on and I was left completely alone, I started self-harming again (tried to suicide but didn’t make the move) but it somehow made me even stronger I decided to move on and improve , decided to get out of the city and go to local sea-side city Batumi , It was best four days of my life. I drank , went out clubbing  , did many crazy stuff it was pure heaven , and I met three girls there(I knew them from the Halloween party mentioned above but never got to know them on a personal level) we passed that 4 days together. After that I went back and started living my life just like before.
My summer physique: http://imgur.com/a/I9XqT  183CM (6’0) 80 Kgs (176 pounds)

  After coming back from Batumi I felt unhappy , I felt really depressed and started eating junk food and gaining weight it felt like nothing mattered but girls who I met in Batumi contacted me and got me back on track somehow I didn’t feel alone I knew that I had friends everything was going great.

  Halloween arrived ! Me and my friends(The three girls mentioned above) went to the party together , on that party I drank a lot and I can barely recall anything. I remember having a lot of fun though. 
The next following week girls started ignoring me and acting really cold towards me I asked why but they didn’t tell me so I decided it is best to forget them… And I realized I was all alone again , No friends no one that loved me , Also my parents treat me absolutely horribly because they want more responsibility from me and think I don’t study enough(even though all my teachers and marks prove otherwise) 

  My life is getting worse I keep gaining weight I lost all will to continue living and think I won’t be able  move on. By the end of 2016 I will probably end my life , Thanks if you read everything , sorry for any plot holes , English is not my native language , I just wanted to share my little story. Try to stay strong folks !  Don’t want to part away without sharing my dumb little story.
P.S I didn't mention my friend and hes hurt 
wounded even?

I can't control them they come out of nowhere. I don't even know where to start with my depression, its just all consuming. It's who I am.

They turned me away because I admitted I use weed as my crutch. I told her honestly that I smoke everyday and use it a lot. I also admitted that its the only thing that has helped for the last few years. They think I need a substance abuse program instead. The rude bitch doing my intake said ""why don't you just set up more appt. with your therapist?"" 

I cant even get fucking help right. I'm hopeless and I'm a piece of shit. I deserve all the pain that I get and then some. I hope they're okay with what they've done. Wonder how they'll feel after I kill myself or put myself back in the hospital for trying to kill myself.

ThrowawayCauseMom,5bvpnu,1478636825,"My Mom's currently in a deep dark place. Long post, but I still need help with this.","Hey reddit. I really need someone to talk to right now, especially when it comes to helping my mom out of this. My mother is around 50 years old, and is in a household raising me, my 20 year old brother and two dogs, while married to my dad, all living in Orange County, CA. This is going to be a long post, so I'm going to embolden everything that's a red flag to her situation, or highly significant in my eyes right now.

About 30 minutes ago, she stormed out of the house, after she mourned to me about her life, **how nobody seems to care about her (Her key phrase throughout all of this is that nobody ""Picks her""), and how the hurting would stop and that life would be better off for us (My father, brother and me) if she killed herself. She also noted that if she killed herself, we wouldn't really bat an eye either way.**

This all came after a trip over the weekend spent with my father and brother visiting extended family in San Diego (About an hour and a half away). That same weekend, my mother wanted to go to a dog park brunch event with my dad, but those plans seem to have been scrapped by my dad when he got the call from his sister that they'd be in San Diego that weekend. They had a long argument about it around 3 weeks in advance to this happening, and I consoled her about it in the meantime. I did ask if she would be mad at me or be fine if I went if he actually ended up going, and she gave a yes. After the weekend trip was over, we got back home and **she was silent to all of us. Today was the first time she spoke to me since Friday** , and I used that opportunity to talk about how annoyed I've been at the silence, and the mourning within the second paragraph above happened. 

**My mother has had talk of suicide before**, as she's reached the boiling point in arguments with my father many times, with her getting to the point of yelling, with my dad still in a low tone, confused on why she's mad. **I've been able to calm her down and console her every other time**, and spend a lot of time to make sure she's heard, and that I understand where she's coming from. **This time has been different, since she says that everyone in the house including me makes her feel like nothing.** 

She hasn't had a good childhood, with her parents abandoning her and her 4 siblings at an early age in the bad parts of Baguio, but she often refuses to outright admit her parents neglected taking care of them. After somehow graduating college, she was able to get a visa to the U.S. to help serve in our church, with the main headquarters of it being stationed in Anaheim, CA. That's the place where she met, and married my dad a bit later on. The church is a big part of her life, dedicating a lot of her time to prayer and incorporating the bible's teachings in her life. Even looking from an objective standpoint, it hasn't been too negative, but she admitted in her mourning that **she hasn't been reading her Morning Revival anymore for the part 3 weeks (A sort of prayer guide). I'm not really all that into it, but she's stuck with it for the past 30 years or so, so hearing that was a big red flag. She said that she's felt like she's begging with God for a better life and to not bring her closer to killing herself, but that she's just wasting her time, so she stopped.**


My father has sparked situations like this before, as he's a very energetic and surface level person. He's great at his job, has a scarily upbeat attitude throughout, but is terrible at listening and social nuance. He often doesn't listen to my mother much, and when he does, he misses any feeling or context behind the words. **He's admitted to me somewhat in secret that he doesn't try and listen that much anymore, since he feels like he she's mad even when he tries to get it right.** Short term and long term arrangements they make together get tossed out of the window fairly often, or even if they're attended, he'll be distracted by working ahead for work, playing on his phone, or chatting up strangers. It also doesn't help that my mother remembers mistakes for a long time, so every time he forgets plans with her, Mother's day, or her birthday **(All three are appallingly regular), she remembers it later, and adds to her hurt.**

When she's not busy with cooking or taking care of the house, or if she's been stood up on plans again, she'll usually be on Facebook. This doesn't help things, **as her friends are always posting great romantic trips they're having with their husbands, or wonderful parties they've had for special events, reinforcing the fact that her own events have been shit year after year.**

All the more, she does guilt trip her family a bit, bringing up past disappointments that have no bearing on the issues at hand to try and make us sympathetic to her point of view. This may be a minor point, but my brother told me to possibly post this to /r/raisedbynarcissists instead of here, as he's been a bit manipulative with both of me and my's brother's time in general. 

That's all the backstory to it right now. After she stormed out of the house, I called my dad and explained the situation to her, and  called her afterwards to try and make sure she doesn't try anything drastic while she's out of the house. She answered the call and said she's trying to distract herself from the current situation, so she went out and voted, and was doing grocery shopping as we were on the phone together. She mainly talked about the same stuff she said in the second paragraph, **but focused a bit more about how I'd feel if she was gone. Something that especially stuck to me is that she said she'd ""end up as the old lady in the nursing home that everyone forgot about"",** and hung up soon after. In the middle of me making this post, she came back home, and has remained silent to me and my brother all the same.

I don't know what to do, reddit. I love my mother, and I care about her, but I don't know what to do. She's mentioning killing herself to stop the hurt, she feels like a burden, and isn't receptive to much consoling like she usually is. I know she needs help, but has gone to marriage counselors and such in the past, but it didn't work at all according to her. I just don't want her to die. I've read all the resources in regards to the talking tips and risk assessment guide, but I need help to help her.

Thank you for your time. "

someonetowatchoverme,5eqs7n,1480033360,Don't know how I got here,"So. I lost my job a week ago. Two days after I told my manager/coach about how difficult things are at my job, dealing with autism and depression. Completely legal, temporary contract --though I had been working there for 8  years. The next day, probably the worst day of my life, my partner gets drunk and picks a mean fight with me. He's a nasty drunk. 
Tonight we're both drinking. Another fight. He hits me. He has a history of hitting his girlfriends. I've seen it happen. You know all the excuses, abusive childhood, only when he's drunk etc. But now they don't sound like excuses anymore. They sound like just a small part of the story of the man I love. And I know how it sounds, dtmfa and all that, but it's just not that black-and-white. I don't know what I want. I thought about knives and stuff but I've held that knife once before, a long time ago and I just couldn't. But now, I don't have very strong ties to family and friends. It's just me. Why shouldn't I. 
I want a do-over. 
This is not at all how it was supposed to turn out."
Imaychangethislater,5annin,1478055989,I'm worried,"Just today I had 2 periods of suicidal thoughts that are starting to make me worried. I don't think that I have periods of depression is helping either. I'm able to fight off the thoughts but I worry that some day in the future I might not be able to. Even typing this is making me cry so badly. I'm currently working at an internship which helped to give a bigger sense of worth but the fact when I think that no girl has ever been interested in me really makes feel depressed and now even suicidal in thinking that maybe there is no one out there for me. I'm not sure at all what to do, I keep forcing myself to press on but each day feels both physically and mentally exhausting. I'm also not sure if what happened recently (A girl I kind of liked and wanted to know better turned out to have a boyfriend) is affecting this completely or what but I'm trying to deal with this. I think I might just never find a girlfriend and I can't really deal with that because I currently have an outwhelming desire to get a girlfriend and be able to spend time with time even through bad times. Also as a sidenote I am currently 22 but I am on the autism spectrum so some things seem to come slower than others such not tying my shoes until around 15 and only recently making some progress in terms of being able to drive. There are other things as well but it might be easier to look them up (noise, not detecting nonverbal). It just really hurts though to feel so useless that no one loves me (excluding my parents). Also my parents and others seem to keep saying ""things will get better and work out"" yet I can't seem to believe them when it doesn't feel like it will at all. I'm currently not making money (though maybe that will change if I can stick through this) and feel extremely lonely as well even since I graduated from college. To be honest I think my depression seemed to start in college due to the stress of having 6 classes at once and not being able to balance things well and even since it's just continued to be there. I personally don't hide my emotions in real life yet I feel worried a lot and not as happy as I used to be. My attempts to try and become noticed on youtube are terrible and I don't really have time to even upload really unfortunately and things just aren't working out. I do extremely long to meet a girl that will be right for me but sometimes I really wonder whether that person even exists. Lately I haven't even been able to control my dreams to be peaceful and I haven't been sleeping that well either. I'm just not sure what to do can anyone help?"

CMDRHann0,5bdh4j,1478396509,My social ineptness.,"I know this might sound stupid and vain but it's really affecting me. Basically all of my friends around me are social. I might even consider myself social but in certain situations but in others I'm completely inept. I'm unable to string a sentence together. I know I have friends and family who love me and care for me, but what's the point in me going on. I'm nearly 18 and I can't handle simple situations like talking to certain people. I often wonder what's the point in going on. We're a social species and if I can't handle these situations now how am I suppose to handle life in the future. I don't want to die, but I also don't want to be a burden to the people around me. I want to be able to get a job. I want my friends and family to be able to live a happy life without me weighing them down. If I had a choice I'd choose never to be born, so my friends wouldn't have to deal with my social ineptness. Their life would be easier without me.They could have fun going out without me being there, without me existing. They wouldn't have to hold my hand. They would enjoy themselves without me. I'd be happier dead knowing they could live a fuller life. They deserve better than me.

throwaway_2372187,5djme8,1479431003,I'm trying again tonight.,"I let myself live once, and all that this extra time living has showed me is that living isn't worth it. I don't care anymore. I still haven't gotten better in school; in fact, I've gotten worse because I can't focus and I can only think about how I hurt the people in my classes and in the halls that I've previously wronged and how I'm a failure for not doing well in 2 classes instead of one now. I come home to do homework and I fall asleep from the stress. I wake up and I go back to school, until Saturday when I waste my life and Sunday when I'm dragged to church where I'm unintentionally berated for who I am, only to waste the rest of the day not being physically able to concentrate on homework. I'm overloaded. I'm burnt out. I can't do tutoring because I'm scared to talk to my teachers because either they don't like me or they get mad if you don't know the content. I'll never be able to meet my goal of having a pet fox, the one fucking thing that could possibly give my life meaning even if I'd suck at it, if I don't pass college, and I can't get in easily if I fail high school. I'm too stupid to do college, and at this point I don't want to. I can't get a job because of how lazy I've gotten. I don't want to stay with my parents and burden them down. I can't take five more years of school. Everything about me seems to be broken: my sexuality, my work ethic, my speech, the way I look, the way I think, my memory, my hearing, my eyesight, everything. Nobody has ever expressed any interest in me, and in the one case someone has, I turned them away with the stupid, impulsive, assholish side of myself. I can't talk to a professional because they can't fix my situation, they can only medicate me and lie to me about my situation. I don't care who I leave because they'll get over it. Letting myself suffer because other people might get sad (most people at school will probably get disappointed at best) when you finally end it just seems selfish on their part to me. I'm not getting put on meds. I don't want to blind myself with drugs to the hellish situation I'm living in. My parents won't get me real care because apparently real therapists aren't Christian enough. I have so many more reasons but I'm too stupid to remember them right now. I'm tired. I'm trying a new version of what I did last time that is more likely to off me for real this time. I don't even know why I'm posting here if I'm so set on doing this, but I have to end this miserable cycle soon. I'm a lost cause and I'd rather pass away under the radar so everyone forgets I ever existed. I'm sorry if this doesn't make any sense because I forgot something or just because I'm a god awful writer. At about 12 CST, I'm doing it. 5 hours left. Goodbye."

justjerod,5bx62a,1478651770,"33 years old, life sucks then you die.","I'm 33 years old, just had a birthday to remind me of everything I haven't done in life. I'm handsome, smart, kind, and genuinely a good person. I have nothing to live for. 
I just do not know where to start. At 27 I had a mid-level management job, worked part time as a bartender, made good money had a live-in girlfriend. Was (and still am) a good, honest, and loving man. She got pregnant and things went terrible, I didn't know what I was doing I tried and tried to be supportive and loving, I put her on my insurance, took over the majority of all of our mutual bills so she had to work less, and it was never good enough. 6 months into the pregnancy she moved into her parents house and after counseling, during and after she gave birth we just couldn't work it out. I understood that we couldn't be together because of her family, and how invasive they were and how I couldn't deal with her not being able to create boundaries, she had issues with me and by all means I am not perfect. I am and know my short comings, through this issues with my substance abuse (primarily alcoholism), depressions, and bi polar episodes started to resurface. At 28 here I was trying to co-parent with someone who hated me, who wanted nothing more than me to fail, and made my life a living hell. See she was a family-law paralegal. She had free access to every legal entity she needed. I couldn't win, I was forced to take off work and attend hearing after hearing about nothing. I hired the best attorney I could afford and cleaned out my $15k in savings in less than 9 months. I was missing work, losing the woman I loved, losing the child we made together and beginning to spiral out of control. I was the best father I could be when I had the opportunity to be I saw him twice a week, and 1, 3, 5 weekends. He was my world and I NEVER let him see me down or was I drinking when he was with me, we did everything together, he was only 9 months and my expensive attorney was able to get me great visitation. I loved loved, my son. Here comes 29, things are good still making my way, had to quit my part time job after my son was born and was still in middle management doing okay even with all the turmoil, I was barely making ends meet but was able to make child support, and his insurance. Things were tight I didn't have anyone helping me, I have family but they're not extremely involved, my father died when I was 21 and there has been a divide ever since. Things were okay, so I asked for final orders in our child support case, she declined and started to rip the foundation or everything apart, she somehow realized or found out I was broke. I couldn't afford another legal battle and certainly not the mental fight that came with it, well that's exactly what I got, here I was 29 having my heart ripped away from me, I started to spiral, but maintained a good relationship with my son. Thanksgiving of 2013 he was supposed to spend with me. The Tuesday before I was served with temporary orders, stating that I was legally obligated to appear before a judge before things were able to see my son again, I didn't have an attorney she knew that. I called, I texted, I emailed, I showed up unannounced to her parents house (where they lived) and was told to leave or they would call the police.  I begged, I pleaded and this was the end I spiraled out of control it took one weekend I was drunk waking up drinking, drinking all day, I didnt know what else to do to numb the pain, hurt, hide the depression. Work got worse I couldn't focus in and out of court no attorney to represent me, fighting asking for help from the court, pleading and pleading and nothing. I finally gave up, I lost my job shortly thereafter I was just under 30 and had no job, no kid, no savings nothing. I had an alcohol problem and severe depression. I decided (stupidly) to change paces, I went into the underground, I started working as a poker dealer, and managed a late night poker game, illegal poker game not high stakes but was making upwards of $1500 a week cash. But the bad habits only got worse, I met a girl and decided to enter a relationship that was tumultuous, to say the least. I moved in with her. Had never done any hard drugs with the exception of a few tabs of ecstasy in my teens. She smoked weed all day everyday, she used cocaine nightly, popped pan pills, adderall, and xanex. Eventually that she turned into we. I was blowing through money, partying every night, sure it was fun at the time but it was only a band-aide for my depression and bi-polar disorder. This lasted 2 full years, fucked up everyday, when I wasn't partying I was running a poker game or recovering from the all day all night partying I was doing In and out of strip clubs, bars, just living a sketchy life. Thought about my son daily but was too fucked up to do anything about it, the party was always on almost like I turned into this character, I woke up was 30 years old in a doomed relationship cheating on her with some stripper. So I decided to get myself out, called my mom and asked for help. She declined, 3 more months and it got even worse, woke up and tried to kill myself the first time, swallowed a bottle of 30 xanex and hoped I didnt wake up. Well I did, they called my mom and she showed up. Shes well off but she and I have our own discouraging relationship. She's well off financially,  but she cheated on my dad when I was 11 broke up the marriage and was forced to grow up very quickly. Anyway our issues set aside, she took me in. I had nothing but a tv, maybe $1000 and some cloths to my name. I have a two and a half year gap in employment, emotionally broken, fighting to stay sober. Oh I forgot my car was totaled by an uninsured driver and my insurance company refused to pay. So here I am 31 living with my mother, no job, no car, and everything else on top. I needed to heal before I got it together enough to try and mend the relationship with my son. Well my mothers husband (the man who she cheated with) is sick with cancer. So the last thing she is looking for is another sick person to take care of. She enjoys telling me how much of a failure I am. I get so depressed I try suicide the second time, first I try hanging, but i'm 250 lbs and I don't know how to tie a noose. So I drink a bottle of captain morgans and take her husbands pain pills and combine them with sleeping pills well, my mom finds me and calls ems who save me and put me in a  intensive psychiatric stabilization facility where the help the offer isn't what I need. I just want peace. I reach out to my sons mother to try to regain something and I am served with papers to relinquish my rights, and allow her new husband to adopt, I decide that is whats best. We fought, I want my son to have a good life and I couldn't give him what he deserved. My mother kicks me out
Here I am homeless, at 32 only 5 years ago I had a 401k, $20k in the bank a job with promise and now nothing. I meet an old friend, who takes me in somehow we become romantic, she admits it moved to fast but she takes care of me but is controlling and I can't really fight her off, I was arrested on a felony drug charge during all of this as well, I haven't been convicted but still isn't helping my depression or quality of job opportunities. I have worked short term here and there but it is a daily battle to fight depression, mood swings from bipolar, and substance abuse.  
Finally here I am 33 no job, no car, no friends, no family, somehow I managed to meet a woman who takes care of me. I can't hold a job and am so depressed I don't want to get out of bed. I have sought help for all of these things meetings, medication and still can't get it together, I'm getting closer to the ledge but I keep telling myself it will get better, but it hasn't I'm sober I work out everyday and I don't feel better I still think about my son every minute. I have a decent resume but I have a felony drug charge (not a conviction) and a 3 year gap in employment, oh and no car even if I did have a job. I live with a woman who controls everything I do, but she loves me and takes care of me so what can I really do? I'm hopeless, lost, and nowhere to turn for help so here I am looking at Potassium cyanide and just waiting for the right moment, peace be with you all. "
Unsureofname1991,5d0j4d,1479182401,"At a loss, overwhelmed","I don't even know where to start. I definitely don't know where to start without sounding like a whiny bitch. 

To start, I'm mid 20s, male, dad to 4 kids. Married. Unemployed. Major anxiety, don't know how to handle myself anymore.

To begin, I love my kids to death. I don't feel equipped to deal with them.
I love my wife, I don't feel equipped to deal with her.

I wish I had a job, nobody answers back. 4 months, no money, Christmas coming up, I'm getting impatient. 

My last job was at a liquor store. Nothing fancy. Lost that due to a few reasons. Drinking, being on my Ativan at work hard, just to ease the anxiety a little bit.

God knows I haven't been the best husband. Don't blame her for being like this to me. I've never offered stability, or anything that would make me a good husband.

Never been a drug addict or a big drinker until recently. The anxiety just got too much to bear. I don't do Street drugs. No tar, no crystal, nothing like that. 
Just went and saw a doctor for the first time in years. He has put me on so many different prescriptions in the last year to balance me out, nothing works. He finally got me on Ativan, it doesn't work but it's better than the other 7 things I've been on.

Was incarcerated for a while in my younger days. They tried a lot of therapy, prescriptions, all that. Nothing worked.

I dunno.

My wife works a graveyard shift. Comes home at 7am. Sleeps until 4. Gets up, goes back to take a nap at 9. I do everything. Not to mention I don't sleep, I never do. An hour here and there.

I've told her so many times, I need some help with the kids, they've been screaming at me for days, i need help cleaning, ect, she gets mad at me, blames me. 

I'm just at my wit's end. The last month ive had constant chest pains, my stomach has been burning. I can't see the doc for a while until I pay him for a no call no show appointment. 
Probably just stress. 

Fuck this isn't even close to everything but I guess that's all I have to say.

My friends and companions during that time were heavy-hitting junkies, true freaks with resources with plenty of axes to grind. I’ve been a part of equally hideous and beautiful benders, brilliant flashes of drug-induced visions on the edge of the sunrise in Vegas, and sedated and drugged through weird cruises starting in Los Angeles, whose end I can’t recall. A weeklong “retreat” to see a friend in Miami is reduced, in my memory, to a single night smoking a seemingly endless supply of crack, watching two thugs berate a prostitute they were holding hostage in a flooded hotel room. How I got there is beyond me… Arrests, overdoses, resuscitations, bargaining, pleading, laughing, complete insanity…at some point I bought a handgun and 25 hollowpoint rounds (hydroshock-somethings, I still remember the green box) and would load it and put it in my mouth on late nights, on my knees, totally fucked up. And as the weeks dragged into months that formed years I departed, emotionally, and became an empty husk. My old friends are now mostly all dead, and I would be too, if it wasn’t for a few key people. The recovery circles would call that intervention “god”; I call it fortune, good or bad, the endless spinning of the Great Magnet…

I am in a surprisingly nice and functional relationship, in a nice fucking room with fresh flowers because I went to the store. *Look how fucking nice it is.* Simple, productive, transparent, and squeakyfuckingclean, all the right ingredients, so...?

The questions of “use” or “meaning” in this context are formless. Beyond that, beyond the well-meant peddling of the exhausted “it is what you make it”, or “it will get better” bullshit, there is the uncharted territory, although I'm sure the depressive philosophical ramblings are equally tired. So, enough. The real reason that this isn’t working is me. I’m sick, I’m obsessive, my head never turns off. It’s my head. And every day I fantasize about blowing a giant fucking hole through the back of it.

Salah.

I need to be writing an English essay for school, but instead I'm here crying. I used to have friends that cared about me. I even had someone who cared enough about me to say that she liked me. But that's all gone. They told me that I'm too emotional and that I need to find new friends. I miss them. I miss so many people. I go my entire day and all I can think about is my old friends. I listen to songs that remind me of them on repeat. I can barely walk through my school hallways anymore in fear that I'll run into them. Without anyone, I'm nothing. I don't have anyone else to talk to anymore. All I do is go to work and cry. I was admitted into a hospital a few months ago because I had thoughts of attempting, but now I really want to die. Maybe it'll get their attention. It makes me happy to think of how they would react to my death. I just don't know anymore. Someone help."

Last year October I was kicked out of my house by my mum and dad, they had a lot of fights and couldn't handle having me around also. I left and a friend let me stay with them since, I've been trying to find a job, I worked a little for awhile but got laid off. I don't have a license or a job at the moment and my friend has had enough of it.. which is understandable. I've talked to him a few times previously and managed to beg for a few more weeks but it's no more this time.

He said I have until this weekend to get out and now I have no where to go and nothing to do. I literally can't do it anymore, I've been depressed for over 5 years and now I'm terrified, I don't know how I'm going to survive, don't know where to go, who to look for help. I don't\can't drive, have a phone, have money. I don't own anything to my name and now I'm going to be kicked out and it's no ones fault but my own which I've come to terms with.

I'm thinking of giving up. 26, no job, no license, no life. It's your classic loser in the flesh. I just want help but it's hard to help someone that can't even help themselves.."

I realized that the act of committing suicide was morally ""wrong"" to me, but ""accidents"" are not. I drive aggressively, with out a seat belt, in a car that I chose because it barely passed crash test ratings, on summer tires(this is really stupid, living in Alaska). For a time I also drank large amounts of Aspartame laced drinks when that was a headline. When I learned that even small amounts of liquor mixed with Xanax and Ambien can really fuck your liver? I did that too. Now I'm up to everclear and my prescriptions. And now I'm considering taking up smoking tobacco to add fuel to the fire. Basically I'm trying to shorten my live expectancy to tomorrow.
And nobody realizes that I get drunk/stoned with friends not because it's a social norm, but because it damages my insides. A couple expressed concern about my mixing of Xanax and liquor, and didn't have the heart to tell them I knew about the risk I was taking.
My question to you is, provided my family and friends don't know that my lung cancer/liver failure/ejection through a windshield was intentional, do you think they'll be better off compared to me just running my car into a tree very intentionally(I've had this plan for a long time, I know of an unused road with a straight stretch with a pretty sturdy tree infront of it, I can easily get up to 100mph before the impact, almost ensuring instant death) or putting a bullet through my brain?
I just want to know the suffering I'm going to be putting myself through in those events will be worth conserving my families emotions."

emeliapearce,5dg32z,1479393177,I lost the battle. I really need to talk,"When I was born, my mother had an on and off relationship with my biological dad and my step dad(Kam), she had my older brother James(26) with my dad and then John(23) with Kam. Then me. My dad left when I was born, so I was raised by my step dad, my dad came back into my life at the age of 6, asking for forgiveness, of course me being 6, I didn't understand too much and accepted his apology, however, my mother did not.

I created a bond with my dad, he always texted me and secretly saw me and sent letters and gifts, then he introduced me to James at the age of 8. He was always so loving and caring unlike John who I lived with. My dad suffered from mental health problems such as schizophrenia, depression and anxiety. My mother was clinically depressed, so I was unfortunate to be born with psychotic depression and anxiety. Now this part is **very** important as it ruined me for the next decade or so. 

My mum had an affair with a man who was sometimes violent and would hurt me and my mum, Kam was clueless to this as he was always working long hours or even abroad. My mum eventually found out about my dad and I and told him to leave me alone, I was 11 and I got pretty upset with this as I was quite close to him and so it lead me to having suicidal thoughts, eventually started hearing voices and it got very scary and then I started seeing things, I didn't understand why this was happening to me and I remember my mum saying I was just as crazy as my dad and so I eventually acted upon the thoughts of suicide and then the police got involved. My mum had to let me see my father.

So the next few years I suffered a lot of depressive episodes and developed social anxiety, I could barely leave the house from age 12-15, I as too afraid to go on public transport or even go to the shops on my own, I'd have to bring my little sister to do the paying (*I gave her the money*) as it was so bad. James and my dad were both very supportive of me, my mother was in denial that I had anything wrong with me and kept saying I had nothing to be depressed about. This made me turn to believe I could not talk to her about my problems, regardless of how many times she says I can talk to her, she dismissed my ""problems"" as if they were nothing.

January 7th 2015 my dad killed himself. I kept this from my school as I didn't want the *special* treatment, the only support I got was from my brother. My brother had a lot on his plate, he had a wife and two kids, one is 3 and one is 7. He constantly was working too, so the only way to provide support was he paid 100 pounds per hour(2 hours) once a week for me to see a private psychiatrist (we come from a rich background on my dads side). I loved my brother because he tried so hard to fill the void my father left.

September 11th 2016 my brother took his own life. My college is providing so much support, but I cannot even get out of bed anymore, not even to go and pick up my prescriptions from the pharmacy around the corner, I no longer take care of my personal hygiene and soon I'm hoping to succeed, this will be my 4th attempt. Hopefully I succeed this time. My mental health has won the battle I've thought for 17 years, I'm no longer Emelia, I'm depression, psychosis and anxiety."

LawnMower420,5crsoy,1479068003,"I'm not ready to kill myself, but I'm pretty much done with life","Hey guys. First time posting here

I've been struggling with depression for a while now. It started mainly after my girlfriend cheated on me. I've always been picked on and bullied and had trouble making more than 2 or 3 friends at a time. This meant that I've always been quite insecure about myself. I've always felt like the outsider. Then towards the end of my high school years I met this girl who turned my life around. We got together fairly quickly and things moved fast, but at a very good pace. I couldn't have been happier.

Four months into our relationship I go through her phone and find out she's been sexting her coach all this time. We talk it through and long story short I decide to stay with her. I saw the better in her and tried to move forward from it. To try to come out stronger. She said she'd never do anything to hurt me ever again.

About 4 months after that she fucked someone on her senior trip. It ruined me. I broke up with her, then got back together, broke up again, got back together, and last night I broke up with her again. I hate her for what she's done but at the same time I feel I can barely go without her comfort.

I've gone to therapy. It didn't help. It just made me more depressed because she made me realize that I don't function normally. She made me think worse of myself. I'm going to be seeing a new therapist soon but my hopes aren't high. I failed my IB (some diploma. Look it up if you care), and am having to redo some exams. Studying makes me depressed. I feel alone. All my friends have already moved away to uni while I'm stuck here redoing exams having nothing to do all day. I can't talk to anyone because they're all busy. I sometimes share with my parents but they don't understand that much but do care for me.

I just feel so alone. So detached from everything. I've even looked up ways to commit suicide and strapped a belt around my neck a few times to get used to the idea. I self harm too. And now I've cut contact with my gf/ex again and I feel even more alone. I've given up on life. I'm done. The only reason why I'm still going is because I'm waiting to see what uni will be like. I'm moving in late January. But if that goes to shit, if I end up alone with no friends, then I'll most likely kill myself"

Even after I tell a number of family/friends some of my problems, I still block them out. I always act like I'm happy and okay. I even told them that I act like I'm happy, but they still think that I genuinely am happy.

My instinct is to act happy and put other's needs before my own. It took me a long time to accept that I do this. So I also don't want to hurt them by telling them. I don't want to bring them down. They have their own issues.

Should I talk to some of them about this again? Really make them understand that it's bad?

But the problem is that I have almost no energy, and I am hardly getting through the day as it is without having the pressure of opening up.

While I'm going through this (I would assume is undiagnosed depression), it's hard to trust myself. For example, I tell myself that I'm dramatic and stupid for thinking I have a mental illness even though I'm going through years with obvious depression symptoms.

So I don't know if I should open up about this. Especially with the risk of rejection that just might push me off the edge (which I've been pretty close to recently).

I'm not usually attracted to anyone. I've been attracted to 2 including this girl and I'm 18. I seem to only be attracted to girls that I know very very well.

I never asked out that other girl, but with this girl, I was feeling more weird not saying anything and I said it.

She's a lesbian as of like a year and a half ago, but I still held hope, she's had relationships with guys before. She said she just isn't attracted to guys and is at least 99% lesbian. This just killed me. If I can go 18 years being attracted to only 2 people then what's the chance I find another and she likes me back? My self-esteem has taken a fucking nosedive. The days since, I don't enjoy my favourite hobbies or talking to friends anymore it just feels like I'm being suffocated and I want to die. Or at least not exist in this way.

I just don't enjoy things anymore. I do things for the sake of doing things. I eat to stay alive, I sleep to rest.

She loves the attention, but I don't think I can do this. I think I relied way too much on this girl to like me than I had any reason to and more than she was ever prepared for.

I have had problems with depression for many years. I thought I was improving. I guess not.

doodlemagician,5f2mln,1480207214,I don't really know what I'm Doing,"I'm not sure why I'm posting this so much as I don't want to burden my family or friends with it. I am not even sure how to put into words the way I feel. My life has been hard I guess. Not as hard as so many other's. I don't really think I have the right to complain. But here I am. 

Don't have a lot of friends, at least not friends who aren't also friends of my spouse. Family was...a mess. The only family I have now are my spouse's really. Don't want to muddy those waters. Sitting in my bathtub, trying to man up. Hit up some hotlines and a chatline but they didn't respond. Not even sure what to say. 
""I have started edging into that suicide plan I've been making for six months"" feels really dramatic. Finally making a life for my family, for my spouse who is mentally ill and tells me that all of our problems are my fault. Honestly they could be, I am trying to learn to be a better listener and not push them to feel obligated or whatever in my relationship. I have a chronic illness that's getting worse and much harder to fake it with, overwhelmed by being the primary responsible partner. We have two dogs. They're sweet. I think they could be better off with another family though, I struggle with keeping them healthy and know they could be better off.

Spouse tells me I make things up and lie all the time. Have asked around and no one else in my life seems to feel that way. But you know, honesty is hard sometimes especially if you love someone. Maybe spouse is right and no one else wants to say anything? I feel crazy. No other person in my life has ever had the ability to make me hate myself so much, I guess also no one has ever seemed to think I should. I could be crazy.

Financially dependent on spouse, trying to start my own business. If we divorce I won't be able to, nor will I be able to afford insurance or....anything really. Spouse sort of hangs that over me sometimes. Not sure if intentionally.

I feel pretty lonely a lot. Like I'm not even here and no one notices. Have been sort of passively planning this suicide attempt, was gonna buy a gun honestly but didn't want to spend the money and time when it was kind of single use. Tried cutting myself but I have had my share of physical pain and just can't push myself into doing it yet. I guess that is good.

Don't want to get out of my bathtub, face my spouse, when it's taking all of my energy to pretend I'm not in here trying to off myself. Am I at the point where I should call people? This feels too melodramatic as it is. I think so many other people have much worse to deal with. I wish I weren't so tired of being optimistically miserable every day. Said I love you to my family. Don't want to say anything to spouse. Would get scathing retorts and criticism. Tells me I'm just looking for attention. Doesn't feel that way but what do I know. I am generally confident I guess but it just feels extra sharp coming from someone you once lived for. Literally, on a couple occasions.

I don't know man. I guess I'm not doing it tonight. Kind of wish I had the balls and simultaneously relieved. Wouldn't want to make the house any dirtier than it is, really. Sorry if this is in the wrong place. Didn't know what else to do. Feel free to delete it if you need to.

Maybe just writing this will help."

My cancer made me fight for survival, and to do so I got 6+ credit cards to keep my family with house and food.
My wife does not know of this debt, I hide it daily/weekly/monthly but I am loosing control and fear the bailiffs may be incoming.
I wish I could wipe away any problems for my family but it is impossible, It's all too much, I want to be free from this and I think about how I can kill myself daily.
I have a son and wife , I am in £20k debt that the wife does not know about, my body and mind is fucked, I want to fix this but I cannot see how unless I win the lottery.
I want to die but I cannot die, I cannot leave my wife and son with this burden but I also cannot function any longer."
aharvster100,5e13ws,1479687576,Guys please give this a read. I feel like this could be very helpful. Have a wonderful day!,"I was personally really tempted to commit suicide the other day while I was hunting.  I though that it would just be so easy, an amazing opportunity.  But do you know what happened in the middle of me loading a round into my rifle?  My phone went off.  I had recently texted my crush about what I might do.  She cares about me just as I care about her.  The text was telling me to not do it.  She said she would miss me more than anything.  She told me that she has liked me for a while now. The love of my life texted me just as I was about to kill myself, just to tell me that if I had killed myself she would be very saddened.  The wave of happiness that washed over me was immense.  All of the depression, thoughts that nobody cares about me, gone in half of a second. If I were to have done what I had planned to do even 30 seconds before I would have missed out on the best news I've ever had in my life.

This was reason enough to stop me from what I was about to do.  I honestly burst in to tears.  I was about to be on my death bed but the power of people had actually helped me out, even after I thought no one could help me.

This should show you guys that are tempted to commit suicide to please, please, please do not.  You could be missing out on the single greatest thing to happen ti you in years.  You'll be missed by so many"
Fox_Trot_above_me,5e8ksu,1479785805,I'm a worthless sack of shit,"I need to kill myself at this point I'm so worthless I'm a useless, worthless nobody who makes random people worry about him when they should worry about themselves I'm just a burden that needs to get rid of"
sdifive,5e8tlj,1479789143,Today is the day.,"I've been severely depressed for the last 3 years, and today I plan to jump from 22 stories up, one for each year of my life. I have nobody that I can ask about this that won't try to stop me and I just want to know some other peoples opinions first.

I've been living a life most would consider lucky I guess. I'm a student but I don't have debt. I don't and have never had a girlfriend. I've only ever worked one job for a short period of time. I'm in a degree which potentially has well paying job prospects in the future. However, the idea of working the jobs which come from this degree stresses me out immensely. I'm not a people person and it will require an immense amount of networking and social skills to do well. On top of this there is the stress from not knowing if I'll even be able to keep up with the work. 

The best part of my day is when I fall asleep, and the worst part of my day is when I wake up. I've legitimately tried changing myself and my habits and have gotten nowhere, even getting more depressed from my failure. I'm being pressured by family and colleagues and all the while I feel as if I am slowing down and tiring more and more, to the point where I just want to fall in a coma, or conveniently contract some fatal disease, or get hit by a falling meteor.

DongDongExtreme,5dqyqi,1479531558,My final letter before I end it all,"So I guess this is my goodbye. I know I certainly haven’t had it as tough as other people on here, but whatever. I’ve considered suicide for the past 5 years, and I have thought about suicide every day for the past 3-4 months. Every single day I think about ending it, and now I’ve finally found a good way to do it and the courage to go through with it.

Firstly I’d like to thank everyone on this board for being so supportive. Most of you are really supportive and genuinely fantastic people, and I applaud you for being so charitable. If it wasn’t for you guys, I’d probably have done it earlier. Now, for the rest of this letter. 

My life has been pretty alright in the grand scheme of things. Loving family who spoiled me because I was an only child, had a good environment for most of my life and some really great friends who cared more for me than I could have ever asked… but throughout my life I have never been able to shake my issues. My self-esteem is irreparable, the hatred I feel for others (even my own family) is growing to the point where I’m barely able to speak to my parent without spitting venom. 

All my life I have hated myself, and whenever I self-harmed, I’d do it because I felt such self-loathing that I needed to take it out on myself. That burning hatred was all-consuming and it felt good to let it out. Tonight, when I end everything, it will be the final act of self-hatred – death. Self-imposed destruction. I’m not doing it because I think the world is better off: I’m not that naive to think people won’t miss me. It’s that my self-hatred has overrided every other feeling and impulse I could ever feel. Nothing anyone could say will change that, because I have never wanted help. 

Alex, you did your best. Nothing you could have said or done would have changed this outcome. I know you’ll be sad about all this, but frankly, I’m too selfish anymore to care. I know that my actions will destroy what family I do have. I can’t begin to imagine how my parents will feel waking up to find my body, but again, I’m just too selfish to care anymore, as you already know. Do you wonder why I denied going to the hospital? I wanted to tell you the truth, and I typed it all out, but I knew if I said it that you would probably call an ambulance. The truth is that I don’t want help. It’s not that all I want is death, and that the depression is the enemy. No, it’s more that I want to be depressed. I want to desire death, because it’s all a part of that self-hating game I play in my head.  I don’t blame you if you don’t understand, because neither do I, really.

To the rest of my friends, I guess this might be a bit of a shock. Maybe not, depending on who you are. Either way, I’m sorry to you guys as well. You’re all great people, and I don’t wish any pain upon any of you. This is just the way things turned out. To my band members, I’m sorry for being so uncommitted to our band and I’m sorry to leave you guys this way.

And finally, to my parents. I know this will have destroyed you. I can’t imagine the pain you’re feeling right now. I’m sorry for being so sick and twisted to have done this too you, but if I’m honest, I’ve rarely seen another way out. You guys couldn’t have done any better for me, and you can’t blame yourselves for this. Really, this is my fault and mine alone. I refused to get help, so don’t blame yourself. I hope you guys can carry on like before I was born. I left a note on my table which will have led you here. I’m logged on to my Facebook account on here, please make a post telling my friends what has happened. Otherwise, there is no way they’ll know. You can choose whether to post this on my Facebook or not, I understand if it’s too much.

Again, I’m sorry this is the way things had to be. I just hope things don’t fall apart too much after I’m gone."
Machine_Guepa,5bk42l,1478490735,Getting kicked out of my house,"I will break my long time lurking streak for the first and probably last time. Also excuse my moderately bad english since I'm mexican (and live there).

My mother wants to kick me out of my house. The jist of it is that a plastic bag which contained around 7000 mexican pesos (dont know how much that is in USD sorry) that she was going to spend in paying our house's rent, is missing, and she is blaming me for it since I was the last person to handle it, and I'm know to be very irresponsible, which I accept.

It probably got missing when she asked me to take some of it and put it back in its bag, but my sister and grandma were there when i took out the money and they claim I put it back in its place. She also very disorganized and kind of a hoarder so there is a chance she lost it in the mountains of plastic bags behind her door.

Either way she is mad and wants to kick us (not just me but also my pregnant sister, her son, husband and my grandmother) and is threatening to make us all pay for it. She claims we stole it, or that I accidentaly threw it in the garbage without noticing. The reason my sister's family for living with us is economical so they dont have any money to pay, and I dont have a job, I'm just 18 year old. My sister's family and grandma are with me and they think she accidentaly misplaced it, and that she is treating me unfairly but I they cant do anything about it.

So I'm just writing here to vent, I dont have any friends or anyone to move with except my aunt, and my only real skills are knowing english and being slightly tech savy. Basically I'm what you would call loser.

I dont know what else to say, but I'm surprised at how calm I'm taking things when I should probably be begging here to not kick us out. I wanted to attempt suicide, but who am i kidding im just a wimpy, coward, socially awkard, hikkikomori, neet loser that doesnt have the balls to take his own life. I will just have to suck it and maybe ask my aunt to give me a place for a while and find a job, but if I fail to do after 2 months, then I will surely kill myself. I hope. Haha.

Its 9 pm where I live and she often comes from work at 12 pm so I have only 4 more hours to read your replies. I already packed my clothes, documents and have an offline map of the city in my smartphone.

Well thats it wish me luck or dont. End of wall.

UPDATE: No actual update, its 11 pm now and nothing noteworthy has happened, but I may update this post later.

UPDATE: She found it. It was inside a wardrobe. Maybe it was me whI misplaced it or maybe it was her, it doesn't matter now. 

Its not all fun and rainbows though. There was a lot of name calling and even some physical altercation before she found the money. Things have not changed,she still wants us out but now we have more time to find a place and now she cant say we stole anything. This house is toxic, and this isn't the first time something like this happenned.

Anyway things are not looking as grim now, when I leave the house (which has to be soon) at least I won't have to pay her anything.

After all of this I think this post doesn't belong to this subreddit anymore.

The NHS is probably the shittiest service I have ever encountered within the US. For a ""first world"" county they have a real shit mental health system. I'm currently using the NSH chat. First day I tried them I waited in queue for about an hour (fair enough I'm not the only one) and got to talk to somebody for quite a long time. It didn't really make me feel any better but I got to chat with somebody which is something I haven't done for over a year and a half. I try again the next day, pretty standard. Waited in queue for about one hour then answered some questions then I got thrusted into another queue. Ok then, I'm in fourth place I can wait some more. 3 hour later I was down to third place in queue. The duck? Another 2 and a half hours pass and I was in position zero. Nothing happens for another 30 minutes. I gave up. I try again the next day and wait in the first queue for another hour just so they can tell me their servers are offline. Don't they even give a shit? How many cents do they get from government funding? Next day I try again and I get connected instantly, answer some questions and then I'm thrown into another queue. This time I fall asleep for about 5 hours and when I woke up I was ""0"" in queue. I waited a little longer and got the ""position in queue: 0"" for about another hour. Fuck this."
LetItRain01,5fgaaz,1480389371,Today I feel like dying,"

Dear Reddit, 

I am a fuck up.

I feel haunted.. 

Got in to three car accidents within a 2 month span. Totaled my car on Mischieve Night... Lost my job on the same night. Don't understand how or why I survived such a horrific accident. I don't understand why god wants me live and I'm pissed he didn't let me die.

My friends don't support me or understand how I feel. My family isn't there for me either nor do they care or understand what I am going through. I'm afraid to talk to the guy I'm dating about my issues because I don't want him to worry about me, but more accurately I'm afraid of him finding out how screwed up I actually am and then stop talking to me. 
I'm in such a financial hole I started to have sex with older men for money. I can't remember the last time I felt loved. I can't remember the last time I felt genuinely supported. I feel like I've never felt joy. I'm 22 and I can't remember what it was like to be a child. I can't feel joy. I think sex is the closest thing to happiness I'll ever achieve. I'm sure I'll end up addicted to hard drugs if I continue this lifestyle, but I don't know how to stop nor have a good reason to. I'm considering donating all my stuff to Goodwill and planning out my last days. I turn 23 next month, may commit suicide before then. "
PokeyTheLittlePuppee,5d7ae6,1479270143,I've done nothing to contribute,"I'm just taking up space. Using up food, water, peoples' time. I have no aspirations, no direction. Wouldn't it be easier if I just ceased to exist?"

Anyways hopefully I get the courage because my life and childhood have only been pain and honestly I don't see things ever getting better. All I feel is shame and guilt and I'm really scared. I know this is only going to end one way no matter how long I put it off."
[deleted],5cj2p9,1478928464,My dad walked in on me trying to kill myself and told me to stop being a whiner because I'll never have to guts to do it.,"Typical waste of space millennial living at home, 25 years old, seeing a psychiatrist, unable to get a decent job because I have an IQ of negative-twelve and now floundering to pay off my bills. I just had to shut off my cell phone plan, sell my car, and a number of other things just to pay for food and now I'm being kicked out of the house and have until January. Easy enough, right? Just join the military.

Nope, my idiot friends got me smoking pot and now I can't. My job is minimum wage, they're giving me LESS than 10 hours a week even though I'm begging for more, and in 2017 I'll be 26 and my health insurance on my parents plan runs out and I won't be able to go to my psych anymore which is a waste of time anyway because I still want to die and still try to kill myself sometimes.

My dad walked in on me today trying to hang myself and laughed followed with a, ""Don't be a whiner, we both know you're doing this for attention and won't go through with it.""

Worst part is, **he's right.** I don't need any help because I'm never going to do it because I'm too scared of the pain. But the scary thing is that I still manage to get closer each time and I get excited when I think that maybe someday soon I'll actually get it right.

So first things first. Stop the drugs, drop my ""friends,"" join the military if I survive alone enough to get clean, and work it out from there.

I guess I don't need any help or advice because I'm probably going to always be too scared to actually commit suicide. But I'm sick of feeling so alone and just... I don't know, wanted someone to know, I guess.

Thanks."
throwmeaway1299,5es8if,1480055877,"Been contemplating doing it for two months, feeling really awful right now","I'm not going to delve in to back story, but if you care you can look at my post history.

Basically, I drove away a girl I was seeing because I semi-threatened her with suicide (not really, I just called her a few times telling her I was suicidal). She said I've made her really uncomfortable and told me to stop contact her, but I kept contacting her. I've since stopped, there's no point continuing that. I feel disgusted at myself and the whole situation. It's vile and has fucked up my view on women and relationships.

I don't have a job, at least not a proper one (I'm an Uber driver). I have a Bachelor's degree in Arts, but my full time job prospects look pretty grim. I'm scared of entering the job market and feel like a child in this sense.

I have friends, but they don't really reach out to me. I've tried reaching out to them and they can only help so much. I understand this.

I spend a lot of time sleeping now, or just laying in bed thinking about it. I'm not eating properly. I feel like shit. Sometimes I can see why suicide is not the way, that there is hope for me to change my life around and become the person I used to be or someone even better. But most of the time I'm just drowning in my own sadness. Every day is lonely. Every day I think about everyone else going about doing their job while I just sit at home reading this and other subreddits like it. It's a fucking sad existence. I don't think I really, truly want to kill myself, I just don't want this life I currently have. I think a lot of you could relate if you read just these last few sentences.

I just need some comforting words"

joydivisiono,5ar8y3,1478107649,Can't get over my ex?,"Hi, thanks for taking the time to listen.
As of late, I broke off from seeing somebody who was really important to me. We weren't even official, friends with benefits if anything. We saw each other for around 3 months, but I fell so hard and became so attached. I know it's hard to believe but I was genuinely in love, I have never felt so captivated; literal raptures instead of butterflies. 
This person broke it off with me, because he didn't see a future. And now I feel completely lost. It's been 2 months since, and I don't know why I haven't moved on. I'm feeling extremely low and have lost a lot of hope. I've already burnt everything he has gave me to try and forget. I am crying nearly every night.

Does anyone know how I can get through this?"
bo_pine,5ai2pt,1477990887,I'm sorry.,"After 3 or 4 years of suffering from severe depression and lots of other mental issues, after 5 suicide attempts that ended up in reanimation, I feel that I have strength to end it all. I used to think about death a lot, and I used to plan my suicide so long, and now I finally have a perfect plan and it just can't fail. 

I will see my ex in the last time, from distance, of course, and then I'll hang myself in the night. Such a perfect last memory. The best among everything that my life can offer me. 

I wanted to be better. I dreamt about it since childhood. But some dreams will always be dreams. And now I can finally accept it and move along, straight to the death's embrace. 

I tried to go to therapists and I had hope when I lived in the capital of our country. There were some good ones, but because I have little money, I had to come back to my hometown, where you barely can find any appropriate therapist. And they all very expensive.. So there's just no hope for me. 

I'm tired of being suicidal, I'm tired of these scars all over my body, I'm tired of seeing my old friends being happy without me and judging me for being this way.

I will never find peace in this world. Only when I die.

I write this as a suicidal note for the case if anyone from my past would want to know why I killed myself. But I don't really think that they will ever remember."

avdima,5fb9gk,1480333750,"I don't know what's wrong with me, I'm just not interested in being alive","I've been suicidal before, when things were bad and I was really depressed. But things aren't particularly bad right now. I'm just not interested in being here. And it's difficult because when I'm depressed I know I can go see a doctor, go on meds, talk to a counsellor. When times are bad I know I'm feeling this way because of my friend's death or whatever else is bothering me at the time. But times aren't bad atm, so I don't know how to even start fixing it. I try to do fun 'bucket list' things, so to speak, to try and find some interest in life. I fly around the world to see bands I like, I moved to Australia for a year. Currently I'm volunteering at a safari park, working with elephants, monkeys, giraffes and I also get to hug baby tigers and lions. After this I'm travelling around Thailand and the rest of South East Asia for a while, then moving to New Zealand which is my favourite country in the world. This is the sort of stuff that I've always wanted to do, so I should be happy. Nothing matters. Even when I'm having an amazing time I'd still rather be dead. I'm still here purely because I don't want to hurt my family. 

I don't know what to do. I don't know how to fix this. I just want to be normal. "

"
yamichip,5avd2a,1478156380,I'm so tired of trying,"I've been suicidal for 15 years, since I was 11. I dropped out of college my senior year four years ago. I've tried counselors, currently have a therapist and a MHNP for meds. I've been doing both the therapy and drugs for over 2 years, I've given them time to work. Therapy doesn't help, the meds have only ""helped"" by giving me enough energy to hold a part-time job (which is killing me) but I'm still miserable every waking moment and many sleeping moments (I've had suicide dreams). I do what everyone says will help, but it never does. 

My meds person has essentially given up on me, he thinks this is the best we're going to get. We've tried at least a half-dozen different drugs, probably more I've lost count, and what I'm on now barely helps and only with my energy levels, not my sadness/self hate/etc. He thinks I can just be fixed with talk therapy. I don't have money and very limited insurance, so I can't just go to a different person. And if I did, they'd feel the same.

I can't feel happiness. I've tried so hard to be happy, to enjoy time with my friends, but I still always want to end it. I had one friend, one singular friend, That Friend, who made me feel like life was worthing living, like I mattered and I was safe, and they've lied to me so many times and betrayed me and abandoned me and blamed me and gaslighted me and even after all that I still miss them. I can't stop loving them, but I can never get them back. I've tried many times to have conversations about our relationship, but they always turn it around so I am the villain, I apologize, they get angry at me and bitch about me to other people, and they continue to lie to me. 

None of my other friends or family make me feel anything like That Friend used to. I just went on a weeklong vacation to visit other friends, and I was still miserable every day. I was just a burden and in the way and still not happy. 

And I can't just find new/different friends/support system. I went my entire life feeling nothing until I met That Friend, I'm not going to just find another. Everyone who I would list off as a friend is not close to me, it's very distant casual friendship. I can't just make us be closer, I can't just thrust my problems on them.

I despise having a job. Not just my job in particular, but the entire concept of having a job, of being responsible, of capitalism, of proving my worth in order to be alive, of doing anything even mildly uncomfortable because I never get to stop. There's never a break. I never get to sit down and be happy. Everything is just another layer of pain and suffering. I cry every single night, usually because of some specific feeling towards That Friend, which then spirals into 'life is pain and I want out.'

And I hate myself. I'm worthless, I'm useless, I only hurt people, I must've fucked up to make That Friend hurt me, I'm selfish, I'm lazy, I have no talent, I have no drive, I hate people, I'm judgemental, I'm jealous, I'm ugly. No one will ever love me. I've never had a romantic partner and no one has ever found my disgusting useless self even a little attractive inside or out.

And I don't have anyone or anything to blame but myself. I've never been abused or bullied, raped or attacked or discriminated against. People have only ever been nice to me, and yet I've still fucked everything up.
I tried to go to my dad two nights ago, but it didn't help. All it did was make him feel bad.

The only reason I haven't done it yet is because I hate physical pain. That's it. If there was a way to end it and guarantee there was literally no pain whatsoever, I would've died a long long long time ago.

I just want to be dead. I long for oblivion. To finally not be in pain after so many years. What's the point of being alive when you can't feel happiness? What's the point of trying when nothing works?

Demographics: 25 years old, white, trans masculine (my depression is pretty much completely unrelated to my trans status. Honestly it's probably the only thing I don't hate about myself). Living at home because I can't support myself.

SadnessAndFear,5aihi5,1477999145,...Please Help,"I've lived 18 years of my life and I could honestly say that there has not been one day where I was truly happy. I do admit that I have had good experiences but they have all been for other people. Recently I did acid which really tripped me out and I repeatedly tried to reach out to friends and family only to have people ignore and joke about me as I panicked. This has repeatedly happened even when I'm not on drugs and am just saddened by life. That is that moment that I realized that no matter how many ""close"" friends I had there was not one who could help me in my bad trip. I have learned some things about myself. I learned that no matter how much I played off that I was happy or positive that I am not. I think I honestly have depression and I really don't want a future for myself. I have always done what has been expected and asked of me by other people and it is starting to wear me down. I absolutely can't see a future for myself and this thought doesn't scare me, it only numbs my feelings to the point being able to function another day. I know I sound like a bratty kid or privileged but I really don't know what to say or do anymore. I have noticed that anytime where I'm in a position of loneliness that I truly think of myself and how I don't want anything. I have even told to live my life so I could find something to do and be happy and work for it, but I don't have anything to live for. I have no talents or motivation or interest in anything. I have followed on the road to become a doctor because that is what I was told would be a good goal by everyone around me. I truly don't see the purpose of living any longer. I have repeatedly injured myself as a desperate cry for help but no one has seemed to care and also to make me actually feel but it has not helped. The only reason stopping me from fully committing suicide is the fact that my parents had to take care of me since I was young and committing suicide now would only be selfish of me. I hopefully know that if I were to do it that it would hurt them and that is my sole reason for existing. Please, this is a desperate cry for help from me to anyone... please help"

I wish somebody cared but they don't, the only reason I'm still in my friend's life is because she know's I would most likely end it if she left because I would be alone but at this point it doesn't even matter because I basically am alone. I wish I still had the mindset of 13 year old me because then I could finally die like I should have then. Now I'm gonna suck it all up and fake every emotion for the next hour until my mum leaves and then I'll feel like shit after. "
Dirk_Hardware,5b5byh,1478284570,Rolled nothing but cosmic ones,"So Im losing my mind and God damn so I wish I could stop the world and get off for good. Fuck me another thunderously original post right?

I was born with epilepsy and Tourettes syndrome. My dad was a heroin addict for most of my life. My mom is still an alcoholic with a taste for pain pills. My brother has also just gone full Trainspotting.

After I finally got away from them my epilepsy got way worse. Now I take a near toxic amount of Depakote just to shit and injure myself every two months instead of going into a coma and having my kidneys shut down. 

I live in constant fear of my body destroying me or else someone discovering my epilepsy because when I do find work its on film sets. Im also terrified that people will find out about my Tourette's.

Im ravaged by constant anxiety and depression. Leaving my apartment feels like a charge across the fucking Somme. Ive been battling near daily thoughts of suicide since before I can remember. Im 28 years old and I live w/ my dad doing Temp work while my younger friends work at high powered PR firms and pitch scripts to Ridley Scott. 

Im terrified of talking to anyone about this because 1) I remember when my mom talked to me about wanting to kill herself and it forever fucked up our relationship and 2) Ive already been to psyche once and Im never going back.

Im an accident of the universe. God rolled nothing but Ones during character creation. Id rather punch my own ticket than know that my friends are talking about ""what the fuck happened to Dirk he never got his shit together while I wait for the one big one that finally cripples me so badly I never leave a hospital again.

sarahravenclaw,5aw2dp,1478170749,Unheard,"So many people in real life, online and even on SW tell me to see a doctor regarding my problems. How can I see one when they're  so terrible regarding the simplest of issues?

I'm a young woman and I'm going bald. I know it's a result of stress but I want something to stop me going bald. I have been to 6 different doctors and they just give me more vitamin B. I dont want more vitamin B. I've been taking it for more than a year and if anything my hair has been falling even more rapidly. I've got massive bald patches and I'm going to go fully bald in at least a month. 

My doctors don't even give a fuck. I've just come back from an appointment today and my doctor said my hair loss is normal. I was pissed off. I ran my hands through my hair and a clump of it fell out. I asked if that was normal. He said it wasn't fair because I pulled my hair. If he's blind enough to miss my bald patches and how much hair falls I give up.

You really think these people will do anything for something as sensitive as mental health? I have lost faith in doctors. I don't want to see them anymore. I'm sitting in my car outside my doctor surgery crying because I just feel so unheard. No one cares about me or even my health. It's so  hard to live as it is and trying to get support just feels so pointless. It's so tempting to just give up."
HalfwayShadow,5at1y6,1478125902,Conflicted,"What do I want to say. What do I want to unburden myself off and afterwards merrily skip away from. I guess it's the thoughts of suicide that I have constantly roaming in the depths of my head that I devote every waking moment to abolish. But they still creep through. They wiggle their way to the front of my mind and leave me terrified that I've come to this point. I don't want to kill myself. And the circumstances surrounding me shouldn't evoke ideas of this magnitude. And yet here I am. I reach out for help but it's a slow crawl until I get someone professional. I know there's a brighter future for me out there, somewhere. I know I can turn my life around and be all that I want. And still, here I am. Walking through life without a care in the world until it hits me. And then I'll start planning. Thinking furiously, how do I get out of this, how do I change this. Then; why even bother. I've put myself in this situation, shunned all I had going for me. The loss of face for me and my family should I ""re-surface"" would be unbearable. As far as the world is concerned, I'm already dead. None but my family would miss a step if they heard I died.
And now these thoughts are getting to me again, and I frantically need to put my mind somewhere else. Somewhere that lets me forget, until next time I remember.

Always poor, always struggling, friendless. I want a stable home, I want a family of my own to come home to. I don't want to be homeless, i don't want to end up sharing an apartment with another mentally ill person that I don't know in some ghetto unsafe neighborhood. I don't want to be scared for myself anymore. I don't want to be plagued by endless depression anymore. My negative way of thinking that's so reinforced it's almost impossible to change. I never see the glass half full always half empty. I'm tired of feeling abandoned and lonely even when I'm with people who care about me. I'm so so so tired. I'm tired of trying different medications for them to suddenly stop working. If I could, I'd start over. I don't want to be in pain anymore. I don't want to suffer anymore. My whole life has been about suffering. People say I'm smart, talented etc... what good is that if you are in deep despair all the time? Too depressed to enjoy ANYTHING, not even a TV show. I've done everything right, I've been in therapy for years, tried many medications, I've tried really hard for many years. I've made huge drastic changes that were mistakes in an effort to better myself. I don't know what else to do. 

I just know that from the moment i wake up I want to cry and go back to sleep. I'm happier when I'm sleeping. I can't wait until I go back to bed. I cry all day. I keep forcing myself through life like a zombie leaning on the hope of others that it will get better. It only has gotten worse. I don't see a happy future at all. I see more of the same because it's been this way since I was a child. I've made it to 30 years old. barely. Why do people want me to keep on living under these conditions? They truly believe that things will get better, but when? It's been 30 years already! My therapist tells me that I have to change my way of thinking. That I have to force myself to think positive and be more optimistic. I have tried and failed many times. She just says keep trying. What if my brain is truly not capable? No, she doesn't accept that. She doesn't know how else to help me anymore after 5 years of therapy. I've stopped making progress she says. I wouldn't mind being dead if I didn't feel any pain and I didn't cause anyone I love suffering. I feel like it's my only way  out. Like I'm being forced out of this existence because I can't tolerate the life I've been given. If this is the way it's going to be, I don't want it. Why isn't it ok for someone to just NOT want the life they have? Why must we always be grateful that for what we have rather than don't have? If that's the only way to happiness then I am screwed. I'm always unsatisfied. My childhood was rough and left a lot of damage and now I'm forced to walk this earth half-baked and miserable and be thankful for it. It doesn't make sense to me. 

I just need some relief from all this pain and suffering and worries and I can't even have that. I don't know what else to do or how to keep on going. People say I'm a fighter not a quitter, Fight for what exactly? a life I dont' want? what am I fighting for? I have no real purpose. I'm alone most of the time with barely anyone checking up on me. I bet if I were gone then everyone would come out from all over the place to say nice things about me and how they feel sorry. It just really, really hurts inside all the time. It's crushing and I'm scared for my life because I don't know how much longer I can take all this pain."

SilverXRW,5bptx8,1478562860,To my parents,"I'm not sure how to put this, and I know nothing I say will make this less painful for you, but I'm done. I've never had any goals or motivation to do anything with my life. Attempting to go to school was just delaying the inevitable. I've been delaying this for years, but I can't do it anymore. 

Something is missing in me. I should want to make my life better, but I don't. Why should I continue to live when I don't care about my life to begin with? I'm tired of fooling myself into thinking things will get better, and there's no point in trying to get help because I know that nobody can help me.

None of this is your fault. It's my fault that I'm a failure of a human being who isn't capable of being a functioning adult. I'm just a pathetic and lazy piece of shit. If I can't deal with things that shouldn't be stressful, how the fuck am I supposed to deal with the things that are? It's simple, I can't. I see exactly where my life is headed and I'm stopping it before it gets to that point.

Maybe if I didn't overthink every fucking thing and stopped being so scared of the world, it wouldn't have come to this. Maybe if I was born normal, I wouldn't feel this way. I know I'll never be normal, and I'm not living the rest of my life knowing that. I just wish I could've been like everyone else.

You have no idea how hard it was for me to make this decision. Everyday I thought about everyone who has ever cared about me. I can't emphasize this enough: It's not anybody's fault that I did this. Some people just aren't fit for life. Unfortunately, I'm one of them.

The love you guys have shown me over the years is the reason I didn't do this a long time ago. I just wish there was a way I could erase my existence without causing you any pain. I couldn't have asked for better parents. You gave me so many opportunities to make my life better, and you never gave up on me. For that, I thank you. I'm hoping one day you can forgive me. I wish the best for you in life. I love you. I'm sorry. Goodbye.

Your son,

Alex"
r4ryt45,5flvng,1480459775,partner threatening to commit suicide,"And I feel guilty and responsible.
The thing is, I convinced my partner to go to the psychiatrist. He got prescribed meds. Everything seemed to be going well, until...
There is this boy that is my best friends for 10 years. There was never chemistry between us, we are just mates. Throughout our friendship he did some nasty things to me, but somehow we always got back.
When I started dating my partner he immediately hated my friend. I told him some bad things that the did to me in the past and it formed an image of an abuser in the head of my partner. The truth is, I should have held my emotions, but even though I tried to explain to him that it's not the case anymore, he hates the friend guy very much. He never openly told threatened me, but after every conversation we have about the friend he gets extremely suicidal. Two days ago he locked himself in the bathroom and later he told me that he held a sharp object and wanted to kill himself, he was very close. I cried like crazy and he told me that he is disappointed that the most important person for him reacts in such way, because it makes him feel like a bad person.
I have no idea what to do. I don't want to lose a long time friend and I feel emotionally manipulated. I have not told anyone because I'm scared that my partner will get mad and will do something bad to himself. When I told him I feel manipulated he wanted to kill himself for being a bad person for me because he felt like psychopath and he hated himself for that. On the other hand, I distanced myself from the friend and he is angry at me for that. He doesn't understand why I did that and he feels cheated because our friendship was very important for both of us. So. Here I am alone. With everyone being angry at me, I feel constant guilt and need to do everything my partner wants me to. I love him very much and I don't want him to end himself. But I also don't want to be put in the position where I need to chose between friend or partner. I feel really sick of this all, I have no idea what to do. My partner doesn't want to go to the therapy with me. He also doesn't want to get any more psychological help. I cannot force him, it must be his decisions. I feel so alone.

Anyone has any tips on how to talk with either of them? I feel embarrased that I got myself to be so manipulated and I don't want to admit it to my friend because he will tell me to leave my partner. And I CANT live him. I would feel guilty if anything bad happens to him. I feel the responsibility for too many people at once. I want to see counselor but first I decided to do a research on the Internet and ask you on this subreddit. How to talk with suicidal people?
Is there any solution? 
This situation is just so sick. I'm afraid to tell anyone, because no one will understand. I feel so alone in this. "
idiot-kid,5b0coq,1478217081,I have a proposition.,"One last stand. I don't want to be a part of this life anymore, but let's just take one last ditch effort to try to live. I want to leave. Try to find adventure. Try to find life, if you want it in a poetic sense. Perhaps every self-help hotline and book I've ever heard from was right and I just need to break out of the rut. I have some money, a car, and not a care about the repercussions. I feel If I go on this alone it will do nothing but prolong my loneliness till I blow my brains out in a Wal-Mart parking lot, but hey, better a Wal-Mart parking lot 1000 miles away than the one in town. That's just my take anyway.
So, could anyone else find solace in a plot like this? Anyone want to partner up till the end of our worlds? What do you have to lose?"

I don't even know where to begin. I'm a 22 year-old, slightly-overweight, stoner who has no motivation to better himself. My job pays decent for retail, but I find myself moving sideways instead of up despite my excellent performance, this has caused me to lose motivation in my place of employment as well as frustration in that I can't find anything this good without college experience or experience at that place of work. As much as I'd love to go back to college (it would shut my judgmental parents the f*** up), I just don't know what my passion is. I don't know what I want to do for the next 50-60 years of my life. I don't even have the motivation to look. A lot of my depression stems from extensive bullying and stigma from my parents due to me being a homosexual. The said stigma has led to me having a raging hatred for my family (even though my parents are the only ones who perpetuate it). I know there's been some  warning about politics on here, but another factor in my overall headspace lately is the results of the election. As a homosexual, I've never felt so hated by my country. The cabinet that the President-Elect has put together so far only furthers my anxiety. I actually hate this country (U.S.A.) now. Plus, my extra-conservative boyfriend (whom I love dearly with all my heart) just doesn't understand my recent emotional troubles. He doesn't understand my depression and how I can go from completely introverted and not wanting to interact with ANYONE to desiring all the company I can get. Which brings me to another part. I would say I don't have real friends anymore. None of my IRL friends interact with me anymore. I shake with blinding rage when they post about themselves hanging out and having fun, while I sit here lonely with my cancerous emotions. Anyways, probably missed a lot. I can't really keep a straight train of thought at all anymore. I'll be hanging around the comments for awhile to clarify and expand on my statements. If I don't find any reason to live tonight, I'm just going to hang myself. Already got a noose tied and a meaningful spot picked."

I tried talking to several hotlines, only to be put on hold for an hour, told that they are too busy to take me, or simply disconnected from the line. I don't exactly have anyone to talk to either, so I'm hoping somebody out there is willing to listen.

Today I thought about writing goodbyes to the people who mean the most to me. And I drew a blank.

And someone said ""if only she had realized just how many people loved her..""

do i owe anyone my existence? i know people love me but i'm causing so much stress and excessive worry. my mom is already burdened by work, now she has to worry about my grades and paying for my psychiatrist appointments and medication (i have mood swings and i need mood stabilizers. i also need Xanax to keep in the house for when i have anxiety). it's just not worth it. i'm always unhappy, and i always have too much time on my hands. i don't want to lay in bed and waste anymore time. i don't want to waste everyone's effort when i end up not being able to graduate high school or go to college. i might as well, right?

the odd thing is, i'm not severely depressed or anxious at the moment, i just feel like leaving. i guess i'm still not sure, because i feel like i can turn things around, but my mood always gets in the way and i always take one step foward and two steps back. it's just not worth trying. even if i do turn my life around, what's after that, anyway? days and days, years and years of work, paying back student debt, still having to take medication and see a therapist, and having to deal with everyone else on the planet. i'm bisexual, i'm mentally ill, and i'm all alone. i don't want to stick around. so much gets in the way. i have obsessions and compulsions along with everything else and they keep getting worse. and there's just so much mental anguish to keep on going. i guess i should do it. why not?

Let me start off by saying I've had suicidal thoughts for a long time. I can't remember when it all started, but it's not important now. Over the past year I have learned and been through quite a bit. I'm going to cut to the chase.

Recently, the thoughts have gotten constant, and I actually have started to follow through with my plans. I've been incredibly happy and everything feels right, and it's because in a sick way I know it might all end soon. Should I call the Suicide hotline? I'm not sure if my case warrants their time, but I also do not want to be institutionalized. 

I always felt very alone. Now it is overwhelming. If I do end up leaving, just know that I did what I had to do. What you all do here is very beautiful for people. I respect that. I don't know. I'm just lost."

There's an appeal form, and why would I appeal if I won't be billed? I guess tomorrow I will have to call them and sit on hold forever and then ask them wtf it means. It just is a kick in the gut though. My attempt involved copious wine along with my pills of choice (why not go out in style?)

Next thing I know the cops are banging on my door and I tried to lie but I also started crying and then they took me away. And then the hospital wouldn't let me leave for a long while. And I played so nice and lied and said that I was fine, it was just impulsive, I don't want to die anymore, I don't have a history of suicide attempts...
You people might, but no body else understands what it's like to fail at a suicide attempt. The rude awakening. The shattered dream. The overwhelming sense of failure and despair. I failed at life, and I failed at death. That leaves nothing but pain for decades for me. I didn't want to be hospitalized. People won't get that through their skull. I wanted to DIE. I don't know how to make it plainer.
To read that they don't deem my stay in the hospital medically necessary just makes me feel like I'm a waste of space and resources. I know I'm not worth it, so why did the system drag me through this dumb process? You have to feel pretty damn low to try and kill yourself. I felt even lower when I failed. And even lower when I left the hospital and still had suicidal thoughts and felt like a shitty human. This bill or whatever it is just makes me wish so hard that my attempt had worked. I regret that I've lived to see this semester of college. It hadn't been worth it. The pain outweighs all else."

Drove to walmart and stole some shells because I couldn't get the small compartment on the fun safe open.. i loaded the shotgun. The plan was to take a walk into the woods so noone would see it or have to clean me up.. i just wanted the hell in my head to stop. I was sobbing, with the barrel in my mouth. When I was about to get up to take the walk, instead of getting up off the couch and heading out the door to the woods.. instead of my legs moving a thought entered mind. I will eventually die someday. But for now, I'm going to do everything I can to reclaim my mind. I'm scitzophrenic and at the time had terrible intrusive thoughts that plagued mind. That was 2008.. i am finally experiencing life again after years of rewiring my brain with the truth about myself. I had to realize alot of things that were not true to get all the knots out. You are the president of your mind. We are all presidents of our minds. That is what we are here for. To make choices. These bodies have grown out of the earth without our assistance, but they are just lumps of flesh without consciousness. You are a little piece of light inside of your head. You've trained your mind to be the way that it is. I am telling you, it is not impossible to escape what you've done to yourself. You can reshape your brain and take back your life and experience things you can't even imagine while harboring suicidal ambitions. Suicide is a comforting thought. To have control over the end of you is comforting for some reason. The truth is, you're not in control, none of us are. There is a bigger picture and we are all part of it. We only have this small glimpse from our faces. Death is not the end. Please, do what you can to feel comfortable in your skin. "

I couldn't be bothered to write a note, so this post will probably be my goodbye. I am 16 years old and a year ago my best friend killed herself. Since then, I've fallen into a whirlpool of depression. My grades have slipped so far that college seems out of the question. My dad is borderline abusive -- he refuses to let me take antidepressants because i should ""suck it up"" and my mom sides with him no matter what. To top it off, last week my only other friend in the world got into a car accident and is in a coma. Apparently he's brain dead. I visited him today to tell him goodbye and that we'll be in the same boat soon. Right now my parents are out with work friends and I have an entire bottle of sleeping pills that I stile ready to go. If I'm not gone by the time they're home, I plan on slitting my wrists. What's one more cut right? 

Anyway, goodbye to all of you people. See you on the otherside. "
Meermouse,5ag5xm,1477960548,I'm a 36y male and I'm sorry I failed.,"I just want to write something to someone. I don't even know why. I've started writing these letters/e-mails/posts so so many times over the years but I never sent them. It always felt pointless, and it still does. But I'm gonna try to get all the way to the end with this one. My whole adult life has been a joke. Two failed relationships. Bad selfesteem. I don't know what to write really. There is nothing for me anymore. There hasn't been for many years now. I keep going, almost as if I owe it to the universe. That's been my excuse for years. That I need to learn new things. I have to understand stuff. Protons, neutrons, evolution, the formation of matter, the mind of humans, sea animals, land animals, plants, anything, everything. For so long I've been swimming in new knowledge because that was the last thing I deemed interesting, worth it, important. But it's not important. It's not worth it. It's just a waste of time. I feel cheated by the cosmos, whatever that even means. It doesn't seem fair. It's not fair. Not that I even should expect it to be. But somewhere I guess I do. I worked so hard. So fucking hard. And I got nothing. I have nothing. I was always a romantic. I bought the love stories I watched on TV when I was younger. You give your heart to someone and she will do the same. It was all a bunch of bull shit. I understand that part today much better. How men and women love, and how it's all biology and reproductive strategies in the end. Just like the animals we are. But still there is this cognitive dissonance in me that just want to believe the story that feels better. I wish I was better at maths, maybe it would be easier to explain all this with equations. I don't know what to do with my feelings. They are always there, but I don't know what to make of them. I'm of no use to anyone, that's for sure. The world would make sense without me. I would like to tell my family that I'm sorry I failed. When I go, that's what my note will say. Anything else would be unimportant."
thisismytruth-,5czmcu,1479171102,Helping those affected by a suicide attempt,"Hi,

Last week I made a silly error and allowed a situation to build to the point I felt the only rational endgame was to kill myself. It related particularly to an attempt to take out a contract on an apartment with a close friend that I was arranging. I allowed it to get to me too much, particularly the financials which were a few days from falling into place.

At the time I sent a message to this friend explaining my decision and apologising for not being strong enough to deal with it and for any lasting effect this may have. My attempt did not lead my death which I am glad of, it was a major blip that comes following a period of settlement of my anxiety and bipolar disorders. 

We have (rightly) put a hold on our plans to move in whilst I seek more help for all this and I feel that I am moving in the right direction.

I am concerned about making sure that my friend who essentially read a suicide note from me gets the right support and with helping to rebuild this friendship. We have had a couple of long discussions in person about this and it is clear that this has really freaked him out, he has been aware of my issues for a long time, we've been friends for 8 years and my mental health problems have been ongoing for a lot longer.

Has anybody been in a similar position on either side or is anybody able to offer any advice?

Thanks!"

I think at this point that I have gone crazy, I have these moments where I cannot think clearly, like my body is making all the decisions and I'm just watching and not even realizing what is happening. I haven't done anything wrong or hurt anybody (or myself). But even now it's hard for me to form my sentences. It's like I'm losing consciousness without passing out. Right now I can't sleep, it's past 3am and I have to get up at 6am and go to work, but I cannot go in this state. I feel especially bad right now and I don't know what to do except end my life. I will lose my job and I cannot afford that, I live in a small and poor country with my grandma and have to support myself. My mother helps me, she works abroad and sends me some money because I have a very low salary. My father doesn't give a flying fuck what's happening to me and he has a mental illness that I think I might or have developed. I'm very very very afraid and the only reason stoping me from suicide is the effect that might have on my mother. She is very emotional and loves me very much even if she doesn't express it very often. I'm sorry if what I write doesn't make any sense, but right now I have close to zero concentration, have random thoughts racing through my head and the only thing I can think is how to end this nightmare. I don't want to, I've never thought about suicide, but right now it is the only solution I see. I can't take this anymore, I cannot afford proper health care, I've been to a few doctors and they said that I'm fine, I've even been to a psychiatrist and she gave me some pills that had almost no effect. Right now I want to go to a field and scream my lungs off until I explode from all the sorrow I'm feeling. And maybe the biggest problem is that everybody treats me like I'm ok. Nobody really understands me and actually takes into consideration what I'm feeling, the daily battle with this crippling feeling that has taken over my life. I've explained to my family and friends that what I'm experiencing is not just a feeling, but an actual physical sensation compared to which my depression and anxiety are like having a cold. I feel so so alone in my miserable life, I just want somebody to really care about me, to actually understand me and say to me ""yes I know how you feel and I will do everything I can to help you overcome your struggles"". But nobody will do that. I feel like the universe wants me to be misunderstood and to suffer alone, like it's my destiny...........

I had it all figured out but love. And I was finally gonna find that, then I was gonna buckle down and take on the most difficult new frontier in my life. Possibly one day realize my dreams of comedy, and blast off into the world.

Except I was rejected by my first love. And the guilt over whelmed me. I fell into the habits of my loser friends, I smoked a bunch of cigarettes. I became filled with bitterness and shame. I failed out of college. I quit my job before then because the overwhelming shame I felt made it painful to interact with people on a daily basis. The loss of momentum of quitting my job caused me to wallow in pity and fail out of college. And the continued shame of failing out of college caused me to never go back to the job that I enjoyed. Afterwards I sold drugs for a little bit, again overwhelmed with shame. Over the next couple of months I blew the $2,000 I had saved up on food and cigarettes. I never moved out of my mom's house. I got addicted to cigarettes, I lost the child like outlook on the world. I lost my physical fitness. I lost my chance at young love. I lost $10,000 to college. I lost my confidence. I lost my friends. I lost my future.

It's all about you and your feelings and how your life is supposed to go. So your son kills himself, so fuckin' what. Want me to stick around and be a worthless shit that makes you feel awful until you're dead? 'Cause that's the alternative. Not like my siblings give a shit about me - and with good reason. They wanna start families. I don't need to be any kind of influence on my nieces and nephews. They truly do not need to know I ever existed. I think my parents would get over it eventually, maybe even live somewhat happy lives. Suicide runs in the family and they both believe in dying in dignity (just not for me. Hypocrites but I don't blame 'em) 

Just let me fucking gooooooooooo. Honestly. Why legislate my suffering. This will never improve. My life has been a steady downward bell curve. I'm just not interested. Does it matter? There's 7.5 billion of us. Just let one gooooooooo

e: I just checked /new here and four posts since mine have been replied to. This is probably the eighth time/account I've used this has happened. Lol. I'm so desperate for help/attention. Such a fuckin' loser. I'm not really offended or anything but this is just affirmation for me that no one has any way to refute what I'm saying. I won't bother you folks again. I won't kill myself tonight but I'm certain I will someday. I will just wait for my father to die. I think my mother and brother could handle it. Goodbye for the last time, /r/sw.

batterfluffyflaps,5e9wux,1479807828,"If I can get better, you can too...","...I suffered from depression since I was in single digits, probably around 8 or 9. When I was 11 I tried to kill myself for the first time, ended up in hospital. From then until November last year I attempted suicide four times. My body is covered in scars. 
Mid last year I stupidly decided to buy some heroin online and subsequently became an addict. Yes it made me feel 'better' but I stopped eating, stopped going to work, basically stopped doing anything except shooting up and nodding out. It all came to a head on the 9th November last year when I attempted suicide for the last time. I filmed a video and sent it to my ex-boyfriend at 4am, then took a wide variety of prescription and illegal drugs, shot up the last of my heroin and laid down in my bed to die. 
Luckily, my ex had got up early that day for work, had uncharacteristically read his emails and drove like a madman the 20km to my house and saved my life. I don't remember much of the following couple of days but I woke up in hospital. After that I promised to stop using but I lied. My ex took me back and I pretended to be happy but really I was still planning to kill myself, and I was definite about finishing the job properly this time. 
But then I got committed and finally got the help I had needed for almost 20 years - ECT (electroconvulsive therapy). I've had 12 sessions of ECT and I can honestly say I no longer want to die. I can honestly say I am happy and hopeful for the future. I haven't even had ANY therapy, group or singular - I'll be starting singular therapy next week and will be having maintenance ECT starting in the new year. I have been suicidal for almost 20 years and now, finally, that feeling has gone. 
Last week was the year anniversary of my last attempt. I cannot recommend ECT enough, it has completely changed my life."

jatenk,5e2stp,1479712132,Writing this in a non-suicidal state - for a time when I am in one,"I am writing this here, because until now I had a blog in german for venting or just writing about my thoughts &amp; life, but now I'm fluent enough in english to write this kind of thing in this language, so I thought I'd try here to get some actual feedback, which I don't get on my blog as almost noone reads it (although closest friends &amp; family know of it - guess I'm not that interesting or important after all).

As the topic states, I am NOT suicidal at this very moment.

That isn't always the case, though. To be honest, it isn't most of the time.

I've been having suicidal thoughts since I can think. Starting off as ""How can I get the best revenge on my bullies"" in basic school, continuing as ""My parents need to know they've been failures"" and currently mostly as ""I'm doing nothing with my life and am a waste of tax money"", I have not known a life without any thoughts of this kind.

I did not do it yet though. The reason for that is that I'm too afraid of the pain that comes with the process of dying - or ending up not completely killing myself, sitting in a wheelchair for the rest of my life, not being able to finish what I started.

I know, though, that this is a lie. I am very aware that there are methods out there which meet both requirements of being secure &amp; painless. I have never researched those to prevent them from entering my head. A friend of mine whom I told about this ""predicament"" started to tell me about one of those methods, or at least attempted to do so - I shut them off (verbally, although I wanted to hit her really hard) immediately. I just can't let this kind of thoughts get into my head - it would literally kill me.

The thing I keep telling myself is that I have no other choice. I have no choice but to keep going. Killing myself is not an existent option. It just isn't.

It's the only kind of self-training (like, the thing you do with a dog, there's no proper english word for it) I do to myself. I've always rejected these methods in other depression-fighting therapies from the start as ""I'm not dumb enough to let myself believe it works"" and ""I'm not a fucking monkey"". These methods would include training yourself to smile in the mirror, having more positive thoughts, writing down what was good in each day and so on - I never did any of those for the reason stated above, and I don' think that will ever change cause I'm a dead-rational &amp; consequent person, if I think it's appropriate.

This rationality does not come from anywhere.

I had an incredibly intense relationship of 22 months with my first girlfriend when I was 18 (I'm 23 now) in both directions - pleasent, and terrible. She was - is - suffering from Borderline, and at least when we were together, she was not in therapy for it, although she was aware that she had it (in most moments). She did not go to therapy cause that would've involved breaking her parent's image of ""their"" ""perfect little girl"" that has no problems and is always happy. She wasn't - but I was one of the very few people who knew that.

She threatened to break up many times, as borderliners do, and I always prevented it. Once, I tried to break up, she slapped me in tears and I just couldn't do it anymore. (Even though I'm BDSMer, slaps are a hard limit for me for that very reason; I'm afraid it would kick me right back into that emotion.)

Eventually, after 1.5 years fighting against her image of herself and others, I managed to convince her that a) she's actually beautiful and worthy of love &amp; attention and b) other people don't always want to use or do bad things to her. Until that point, I sometimes would've asked her to have an open relationship (just so I could fuck with others; being in a relationship always makes me feel like the whole world would want to fuck me if I asked). Suddenly, she asked me to have one - and I agreed, happily. She immediately found a couple whose sub she became (in BDSM-context) and I found - surprise - noone.

That was the second time I lost all control over my emotions which never happened before. I became jealous. (The first time was an occasion in which I let her sleep with a (female) friend of mine so she wouldn't whine about her virginity anymore.) I could not take that at all - jealousy is something for ""minor"" people! So I let it out all on her, even though I was the one who wanted this all along. These two things and fighting more and more often, and a few other things, led us to break up, although it came more from her than from me.

To this day (These three words are, by the way, the title of an awesome poem by Shane Koyczan which I can strongly recommend watching on YouTube) I can not stop thinking of her every day - and dreaming about her every few weeks. Those dreams always have the same kind of content: We meet, she wants no contact, I can convince her to have some and we become at least friends, sometimes a couple again. These dreams don't come from missing her only, though. They also come from guilt.

When we broke up, I fell. Far. I stopped going to work or university, lost the job b/c of it and eventually went into a mental health clinic. I was thrown out 4 weeks later b/c of self-harming behaviour. (They offered to keep me in the closed department; I declined.) But while I was there, my ex with whom I was still friends - or trying to stay friends with - visited me a few times. One day, she mentioned (with me starting the topic) that she would break the rule of not sleeping/playing with anyone else the couple gave her only for me - like, I was the only person she would break her promise for. My brain just could not take that. I was still so much over her that I took that as an invitation, pulled her down to bed and tied her up (as we would usually do when we were playing). She never stopped saying ""I'm not allowed to"" - never did she say she did not want to, so I kinda ignored that. But she would also fight, physically, more than usual. She fought so hard that eventually I asked her if she remembered the safe word we never used - she said no, I told her, she used it immediately. I let her go, she seemed peaceful, but later I got a message telling me that I belonged in jail and am a dangerous person, after which she blocked me everywhere.

The following years, I tried to contact her 3 or 4 times; filled with guilt and the thought that I raped her (although I never got undressed and did not sleep with her, sexual stuff happened on her side) I wanted to make piece with her and know that she forgives me for what I did. Eventually, she answered a facebook message I could send after she made a new account, telling me that she indeed forgave me. We small-talked for a day, then she blocked me out of pretty much nowhere.

A few weeks back, I got another message from her. In it, she says that she lied. That she is suffering every day because of what I did, that I am a horrible person, that she wants to see me dead and that she never forgave me and only said that because she tried to make piece with it herself, but never could. She also said that she never could let anyone get close to her again.

My answer was that I hate myself for it probably more than she ever could, and that she will never hear from me again. How could I bother her with my existence anyway, after I obviously destroyed her life like that?

After this, because I let my feelings take over my actions in this one instance, I never had feelings have any control over my life anymore. I live my life purely on rationality since then, and do not plan to ever change that, fearing I might make such a mistake again. I am not sure if I could take it if I hurt someone like that a second time, or worse.


I've had two (both long-distance) relationships since then. One where I did not pay enough attention for her and did not take care for her so she had to break up, and one that even goes as far as overseas which I ended because of too-much-alternating views on - everything.

This is not the only part in my life that's shit.

I had to stop studying because of psychological and financial reasons. Student-loan-agency would not pay anymore cause I was taking so long - I was only studying half-time, could not do more cause of depression - at most, and I lost my 7th job within 4 years, most of whose I lost b/c of some parts of my personality disorders.

I am diagnosed w/ a narcissistic, a sadomasochistic (which should not get diagnosed at all nowadays anymore) and a schizoid personality disorder. Those are just the three they put on the front of my last - third - mental health clinic report; two others which are mentioned in the text are a schizotypic and a histrionic personality disorder; the diagnosis from the second clinic was just Borderline.

I have a hard time living in general. Everything I do is learned. I had to learn how to behave - not manners, but why not to undress in public, why not to hit people I don't like (although I rarely have aggressions against other people, it's hard to make me aggressive), what signs of emotions are and all this kind of stuff. I can not feel into people - I read them. That's one thing I can do by now. I can read people. I see them and very often know what they feel, even what they think, just because I learned so hard how to pretend to be a normal human being that I immediately see when someone derives from the ""normal""-state. (People who do that permanently - being ""not normal"" - are also those I'm emotionally and sexually attracted to, by the way.)

This messed up many relationships already. But the thing that did that the most until two years ago (when I stopped letting other people suffer under them) is probably my emotional breakdowns.

Every once in a while, I have a complete meltdown. But I do not cry. I do not lie on the floor. I carry on like normal - I'm always pretending anyway, it's not that big of a deal to do that while I feel like my head is about to explode from sadness and rapid thoughts. Oh wait, it is. But I manage to do it anyway. It's virtually impossible to see from the outside wether I have an emotional breakdown. My voice gets a calmer, I talk a bit slower and sometimes clench my fists because I need to leave the force building up in my brain somewhere. But noone ever saw it, and I am not completely all by myself (although I do not leave my apartment as much as I'd like to). There used to be a knife in my fists before, but I stopped self-harm a while ago as it stopped to help against these phases. I also have no scars from it, as I always used blunt knifes or other blunt stuff which hurts a bit more, but leaves less traces; noone can see what I went through this way. I for myself scan people as soon as I see them, and scars on the lower arm parts is something I always - always - will notice on you right away. Same goes for long sleeves when it's unneeded, and I will ask you to show me your arms if I can't get a glimpse on it after some time if you wear those.

These meltdowns got reduced almost two years ago thanks to a medication that slows down my brain a good bit. I used to break down daily before taking it, now it's ""only"" once a week or so. But it does nothing against the depression - and because of me being always suicidal, noone will give me antidepressants or noradrenalins so I start to do stuff b/c both of those raise the suicidility when you start taking them.

What ended four years ago, though, is crying. I never cried a lot - ten times at most in my life - but even that stopped when I got thrown out of the first clinic. I've not cried ever since. I do have little sadness attacks in sad movie plot points, for example, where I want to burst out in tears but can't, but those only last for 2 or three seconds and are gone again.

Currently, I am waiting for the approval of an application for a therapeutically-accompanied  apprenticeship as a software engineer. I do not really want to do it, but I have to do something, people tell me, so I do what I must so they don't hate me. I can't deal with hate at all. I don't care if people don't like me, but hate has a reason - and that reason is my fault, for me.

People in the last clinic have been telling me I try to make people hate me on purpose, although it might not be a conscious process, just so I have some kind of connection to them.

I never had the feel like I could control anything that happens in my brain. Emotions are always the opposite of what I want to feel - and most of the times what is appropriate and helpful to feel - and my thoughts are clogging up my brain like crazy often, even with my medication.

I manage. Somehow, I still live. I have no idea, but I will continue to do so. I am writing this now because I'm somewhat stable. I hope people have read this, although I know how much it is. And I hope they have something - anything - to say that could help me. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.

Every time I just tell myself, ""Hang in there for just a bit longer, it'll be okay"" and I guess it worked for a while.

At this point though, I feel like I'm a lost cause. I'm currently failing all but two of my classes and I feel like the number of friends I have has drastically decreased from last year. I feel like everyone who knows me hates me, and I think it would be so much easier to just end it all.

Sheehan7,5b875p,1478318567,"I'm not sure I'm ""bad enough"" to go to the hospital","I've been dealing with anxiety and depression for months now. I'm on my 4th week of my 3rd SSRI and just started with a new psychologist today. I lost a good friend of mine to suicide and I always told myself if I ever got bad enough I will admit myself to the local hospital. 

Well I think that time has come. I have been thinking of suicide for days now, I'm just so hopeless on recovery, nothing really brings me joy, and I just want to stay at home and sleep all day. I wake up in the morning and don't want to eat, I've lost weight. Combined with that, I started fantasizing about hurting people tonight at work and it scared the shit out of me. I have an 8 hour shift tomorrow and all I can think about is what if I do actually hurt someone, or myself. I go into the bathroom at work and think about all those bottles of bleach, I think about the oncoming lane on my way home from work, I think about the gun in my dad's safe. 

The thing is. I don't want to kill myself, I don't want to hurt anyone, I want to get better, but the thoughts are getting worse and worse to the point where I don't know if I believe them anymore. I want to go to the hospital tonight, get the care I really need, maybe my medication adjusted, and just a time where I can really work on making myself better. I just feel like they wont admit me because I haven't attempted, nor do I have a solid plan."

My reason for saying what I am saying is because i feel so alone right now. My roommate situation is complete shit, one of them is an liar and abuses our other roommate verbally. Basically he has no respect for anyone for himself, so I can't express anything in there. I dont feel supported, loved, or the least bit welcome anywhere else on campus either.

The only thing keeping me together is my brother back home.

I guess the reason why I am posting this is that I am still looking for a reason to live, despite all the shit right now. I don't really know whether or not I'm sad, or I'm just empty."

zvzarr,5e1yx5,1479699316,I am going to killing myself tomorrow,"-I liked a girl who I bullied when I was really young who left the school because of me and turned back up in my freshman chem class in college I desperately wanted to talk to her but couldn't find the words obviously, over the following few years I spent my time working out the forecast model below forgoing college more and more until I just left to go into warehousing probably for the next 50-60 years all to prove that eventually she will not have the option to not ask ME out anyways... For what its worth though I think I do truly love her ( and I don't regret it, not, one, bit ). I will nick my neck in the bathtub while scrolling through landscapes on deviant art.(ideally I would also have 3 large backlight wall signs a stop sign directly to my left ear and a go sign to my right and a slow strobe smiley face slightly raised in front of me at night with the lights off I'm going to check Spencer's Gift shop tomorrow but its not a big deal)

... Anyways its what life is and if you don't care to read it don't bother commenting. I can tell...that's all.

Everything is from dark matter... dark matter lies quantumly with the act of conveying a zero perception... E=mc2 and we are inbred light babies.(sarcasm) m (+ or - )=E/c2 complexing prior via gravity created by a black hole from a (+ or -) star and any electromagnetic waves aka E trapped inside upon collapse. Extrapolation from recent discovery which claims matter can be made from light...I abstracted the following.

Black holes arn't compactors. There are infinetly many ""event horizons"" and on each level of matter, matter is broken down based on the historic events that took place between a previous event horizon.(quantum entanglement from outside) This process takes the complexes of what had been broken down atomicly to create the shape of what we call a universe. For every event horizon passed, more ""parallel"" events form, happening ""relatively"" quickly, on the whole, over the course of taking the ""fading"" events place. As we can percieve relatively only 1 dimensional idea of self, now, by crossing the event horizon it will multiply in the sense our body will cover more space disjointly so that at least a zero dimensional body of me is possible, say a single planet which is capable of sustaining life...maybe(more wishful thinking...anyways_ ), to galaxy, ratio, respectively to the complete waveforms transcribed on all past parts me and only me...The distance between 2 different ""points"", you and me, should stay ""relatively"" fixed to an all but absolute extent.So basically though from this perspective things travel in a straight line funneling down to a point, on that line, the relative way in which it quantifies to us is infinite expansion.why time is theorized to ""stop"". Basically electromagnetic waves pass through and also into either the matter or antimatter gas cloud of a new forming star one which will (along with its own electromagnetic waves) produce a black hole which then produces a more complex universe (it is because of the excess of either + or - matter the new universe would possess continuic properties, or an evolved form, rather than parallel properties. furthermore the dynamics of the evolution, ""rather fluid"", of a single celled organism continuously over the course of billions of years to point of me also technically indicates that this would therefore be a 4 dimensional singular conscious being as well, aka it (not the clown) could be more plant.. buut probably not(sarcasm...god is not with us all god is us all). Starting from spectral electromagnetic radiation produced by galactic rotations and stars (helical), acting on the earth like a speaker acting on non-Newtonian fluid pulling up the first structure of a cell filling it simultaneously in with increasingly complex helical structures, also the first instance of gender, a quantum state which is reciprocated in sexual and non-sexual reproduction, luffing off into sub cellular division. this over billions of years. The minute electromagnetic pull, after death, on the dna moving things slowly into place for a fluid movement of me resulting in a perfectly perpendicular of matter to the last point of ""production"", a now ""zero dimensional"" explosive sum, a fertilized egg in this case. (sort of like how earths electromagnetic field moves the hands of a compass). Though the electromagnetic plane waves (when an electromagnetic field decomposes...what it decomposes into...basically sheet version of the field) will be included into the formation of many different stars which will eventually form black holes the first one to produce a new universe should be the one you ""phase"" in, the rest parallels and essentially first-time existences... any point after the ""zero dimension"" phase (fertilized egg) mutation occurs unique electromagnetic field results corresponding to the new surrounding...MORE COMPLEX...universe...(physicists call them parallel...and are wrong) and all of this may take several blackhole phases to occur depending on how evolved...encompassing, you were. But probably wont concern any of us for a while...""yawn""...Anyways, eventually the amnesia will subside as we evolve. I wonder how long it will take for the collection of someone’s lifetime of moments, evolving harmonically, to turn parallel to each other and progress as one single happening. Forming a new color via infinite reflection on a point of relative infinity given the inverse square law…? also based on the nature of the first cellular sexual reproduction gender should flip as a result of the cell that was consumed now being programed to attack the consumer...which is a definitive physical event shared between the two...being partially consumed first that is. the original consumer will be working out how to keep from dying via genetic recombination and splitting into its off springs. essentially what this could mean for us is that our cells sexually reproduce and essentially causing us to asexually reproduce in place on top of also being able to sexually reproduce with other ""people"". essentially immortality. Basically it is a compounding evolutionary function, life.

Conclusion: Therefore everything perceived present is not and therefore isn't. Yielding only the concept zero to exist as zero and arguably equal to everything as well as nothing: given the definition applies to disjoint infinite continuity. 

but infinitely slower than this was presented by nature.

Until you make the ultimate decision and suddenly everyone makes a big fuss about how ""loved"" you were and how much they're all going to miss you. 

If you cared so much then where were you when I was crying my eyes out at 2am and just needed to vent? Where were you when I was drowning inside my own head and all I needed was a hand to ground me, tell me that I AM appreciated. That I'm NOT worthless. 

I'm nothing but a burden you would rather ignore. Until it's too late to ignore me, so you put on your mask of concern to keep up appearances. It's the way of the world. It's sad, but it's true. 

Rant part over.

I feel calmer now that I've decided to do it. That's strange isn't it? Years of trying to get healthy and be... Normal I suppose, have done little to help, but finally deciding to just do it has brought me peace. Given me a twisted sort of purpose. It's funny looking at it like that. I've bought my supplies and they're on the way. I'm going to spend this week writing letters to people. I'm only sorry about a few of them really. My brother and his kids mostly.

It's too much. Living like this isn't living, it's a sad struggle that seems to have no end. I can't do it any more. Saturday night after work I'm locking myself away with a bottle of whisky and some music and I'm doing it. And I'm really OK with it."
lonelyNdepressed208,5dld7e,1479457102,Going to end it soon.,"I can't take it anymore, the crippling depression and chronic brain fog. I have been depressed since age 17 but it's gotten really bad this past year. I did have a time in my life when I was happy and positive looking towards the future, I had a girlfriend and we were really close, I got super attached to her in the 6 months we dated.

Then one day she texts me tells me she can't do it anymore, has to find time for her self etc etc.. I was pretty crushed, over the next months I tried to get her back but she said no and she was really sorry for what she did, I then found out last September that the week after she dumped me she found another boyfriend and she has been with him ever since. I can't take knowing this happened, she probably was talking to him the whole time and they are deeply in love and will probably have a beautiful life together.

Ever since I found that out, I have had severe chronic depression and I never leave the house, I stay up all night playing video games watching porn and I wake up late, when I don't numb my self with porn I get deep feelings of abandonment and rejection and suicide. 

I've always been a quiet type so I have a very hard time meeting people and keeping friendships, most of my friends from high school are busy in college and or working and have girl friends. I haven't had a Job yet and never have gone to school.

I feel like a massive loser scumbag who leeches off my parents, but I can barely leave the house and if I do I get intense anxiety. I have a decent relationship with my parents, but it's more like a friendship. I don't know what's wrong with me why I can't get over this girl I dated 2 years ago, but she's on my mind every day and if I keep having to put up with this pain and depression I'll kill my self. "

I also have enough money (I'm 19) to go on a miniature tour of the USA. Perhaps go see New York, Chicago, then LA or something.

A third possibility is to not end my life, but rather to just take my savings and disappear. Buy a trailer in the middle of no-where, get a job at Walmart or a factory, find a girl, and begin the minimalistic road to happiness. 

And please no ""Please get help""'s or ""It will get better""'s. It very well may, but I already know that. I'm pretty smart, which is honestly why I'll probably always be so miserable."

The thing is, I feel trapped. I feel like I'm living in a hamster cage. I get up, run in my wheel, eat, drink, shit, go to bed, repeat. I don't agree with the society we live in. I'm not allowed to own anything, unless I'm filthy rich. Everywhere I go I step on someone else's road. I don't want to go to school where I am forced to spend my time on things I don't agree with. I am not ready to start working at a 9-5 job with minimal wage just to survive. If I don't do these things I will be attacked by most people I care about because I'm a ""lazy, disgusting leech"". I don't want to have successful career making millions of dollars, either. I just want to be me.  
 Now, I understand most people will be upset by this, because we're all in the same boat. I understand that I am not the only one, and I did not come here to seek comfort. I just want help.  
I also wanted to say that I am ready to do a lot of things to help our society, and to help other people. I am not selfish, nor am I lazy. I just want to choose what it is I do."

I don't know what to do anymore, I've had severe depression now for about 7 years, I've been on many medications and through multiple therapists. Recently something happened (see my other post in my history for full details, carful if you do read it don't want to upset anyone, I don't want to type it out again, although I feel like I lied as it's not the first time its happened) and it's confirmed for me the thing I fear the most and that's that I am going to become my biological dad.

At the moment I would rather be dead than continue living the way that I see myself, yet I can't bring it in me to kill myself as I do know that people care for me as much as I think they shouldn't.

You know what I did with that opportunity? I fucked it up. I procrastinated, spent my days in smoking weed and drinking, to the point where I was suspended from the school for breaking the rules. My dad being a strict man with a short fuse was furious, but he let it go. As long as I got into a good college with a good scholarship, right?

I refused to learn my lesson and didn't improve. I fucked up so bad that I turned in an assignment late and was denied for my diploma. Add onto that, I got into what my dad calls ""low-level"" colleges and he refused to let me enroll in them.
Now, I'm at home, living with my parents, doing jackshit at home, having to take an involuntary gap year because I can't go to college without financial aid.

Here's how I got to my breaking point:
Recently, I was rejected from a college and my dad blew a gasket. He blamed me for fucking up my life and I've never felt like a bigger piece of shit. I will never get out of this house. I will never get out of this fucking country

I live in a third world country where there are no opportunities to move out or do something about anything. I'm well and truly fucked. I want to die.

It's roots start since I was little even tho it was barely there at that time. As I grew up and learnt about suicide and depression I knew that I am a depressed person with passive suicidal thoughts. What I figured out soon (a couple of weeks ago) is that I'm also masochistic. Well I did punched myself when I was feeling extremly guilty but I perceived it as a punishment I deserve. Probably because of my violent father. But about a month ago I cut myself for the first time, then the night after and so on for a whole week. I counted 14 long cuts on my arms and legs... I know it's stupid and my 3 best friends had told me that I'm stupid for resorting to self-harm but they understood me. After the dark times passed whenever I'd have that knife I used in my roam (I usually take it when I eat different fruits. I use it for peeling and slicing little bits) I think about cutting myself. With horror of what is happening and where I might end up like this but with pleasure towards the pain itself and the punishment I deserve... I don't know anything anynore....

it's next to my bed on my bed side table, i moved it here and it's just screaming at me

My genetics have played me a foul hand, and above that a diabolically cruel one. I am 16, and acing college-level math courses. This last semester I dual-enrolled with the local university and was exempted from the finals for Math 270(Calc I) because of my straight As. I'm a National Merit Semi-finalist, and all my standardized test have put me in the 99th percentile. I should be feeling on top the world, right?

Nope.

I absolutely despise all this academia. Whatever I'm going to do with my life is either going to be something I'm dismally bad at or something that will make me a rich corpse hanging from the ceiling fan.

I can't even find love, because despite my best efforts to lose weight I just can't keep the pounds off and I'm genetically predisposed to have a weak jaw and just be generally ugly as all fuck. My speaking is awkward, my facial expressions strained, and my jokes are only ever bad puns.

The only thing I think I could ever enjoy is making music, and surprise I'm mediocre at best there too. Even if I was good, I'm a homeschooled kid imprisoned in his own house and I couldn't possibly find a band.

tentacleLolita,5ctrmx,1479092318,I've fully accepted that I'm going to die.,"I'm bipolar and I thought I was recovering, but the past two weeks have brought on a depressive episode like no other. I've been exploding on my so-called friends and crying frequently for no reason. After sleeping all day yesterday I feel better. I'm no longer sad, I just know that I'm gonna have to kill myself soon. I'm a burden on others so I need to find a way to fade away. Oddly enough I'm highly calm about this entire thing. "
cyberdreaming,5b273t,1478242859,I don't want to stop living but I think there is something else inside me that won't stop torturing me until I'm dead,"I feel like there are two people inside of me and one of them wants to ruin my life. 

I've always had depression since as far as I can remember. I was always a quiet and sensitive kid. Mostly my feelings of worthlessness sprouted from the realization that I'm not like other people and I'm no good at pretending. School, jobs (mostly high volume restaurant work where I have 60+ coworkers because those were all I can find at my age) and other populated environments are huge stress inducers for me. I am so easily overstimulated (and somehow understimulated, my elementary teachers always suggested adhd but idk) that sometimes I lose the ability to communicate much at all. 

I just quit my job as a server without notice (right before rent is due...) because I couldn't take it anymore. Two weeks earlier I witnessed a classmate jump from our advisement building on campus. (Big city, I think 20 stories.) He didn't make it. There's a parking garage near my job, we have to park at the top floor. Sometimes when I would walk to my car at night after a long shift, after feeling used and unvalued by customers and coworkers, I would think about the fall. I quit but I don't feel free from whatever it was I felt trapped by there.

I know I couldn't do anything like that, though. I don't like the idea of the attention... when this boy jumped everyone surrounded him, snapchatted his body. But I feel like my body/mind finds ways that will slowly kill me in sneaky, subtle ways. And they are more unbearable and prolonged. For example, some people when they are depressed will overeat and sleep for days, but when I'm anxious I don't feel hunger at all. I also lose the ability to sleep. Overeating and sleeping are not good either, but you need those to live... sometimes I know I need to eat but when I'm anxious/depressed I get overwhelmed by things that involve lots of steps, like cooking... I'm not stupid but sometimes I feel locked out of my own head. 

I know I am malnourished, I can feel it, people point out how thin I am. I'm already on a meat free diet (which I have been able to healthily maintain when I eat) but I can just feel how weak I am, the headaches, and losing motivation to do anything, it gets harder to eat. Its a slippery slope

I've tried to seek help before but it never works out or I can't afford it, antidepressants are not right for me, I don't think it is typical depression

I live in a large but tight knit city and I know a lot of people (because of my job and my bf is kind of well known in the community) but no one really seems interested in me or likes/cares about me, I guess I'm also not friendly because I'm shy so people don't like me. Honestly I am VERY closed off sometimes because I fear I am offputting. I don't feel like anyone would bat an eyelash if I died, maybe they would say, ""that sucks"" and go on with their lives

But there is also my boyfriend whom I live with... he is so different than me, very social, always joking etc but when I'm sad I think it brings him down and he doesn't know what to do. I can feel the emotional distance between us when I talk about my depression, because he feels powerless, the air feels so thick and I feel even lonelier expressing these feelings to people I know 

I need to put my heart into school but I just feel so empty... then guilty for not being productive. Even more guilty because my teachers tell me I am very good at what I do. But I can't finish anything and I have so much anxiety. I don't feel like I belong anywhere, and that I am unlovable and unwanted. I can't do anything without a second person in my head telling me how wrong I do everything and how worthless and unlikable I am. 

It doesn't make any sense because I am forgiving and non-judging to others but so hateful towards myself. I've spent massive time and energy on self improvement and working towards self love, with little luck, apparently... every year I end up at a low place again. I swear something inside of me wants me dead. It thinks of violent things happening to me as a way to calm myself down or take revenge on my mistakes. 

I go long periods of ""healing"" where I don't hurt myself, and then relapse out of nowhere. Today I just got so mad at myself for being sad and feeling worthless, because I missed something important at school due to anxiety. So I carved ""LOVE YOURSELF"" into my skin. I don't know about you but hurting yourself by writing ""love yourself "" is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. I don't know who this person is because I feel like I'm the one who wants so badly to be happy... why do I keep doing these things to myself? 

Given what I've been capable of in the past, between starving myself, hurting myself, and overtaking pain pills until I was close to dead (I don't do this anymore)... I know how impulsive I can be when I am like this. I think about death so much lately. But I know I am one of those that if I was at the edge of the window about to jump off, I would know I don't want to die. I think a lot of things about life is beautiful, and I think people are so beautiful, but I'm too depressed to enjoy or involve myself. I just want to kill this part of me that won't leave me in peace. But it wants to kill me, so here we are, trying to kill each other

I don't know what to do. I never post on reddit so I must be in some sort of head space to even tell strangers about any of this when I don't even tell people I know

Please help, I feel so close to the edge "
alienkarissa,5b83d4,1478316940,I feel so hopeless.,"I usually keep all of these thoughts to myself, but I just feel like I need to get my thoughts and feelings out of my mind and somewhere else or whatever.

I can't see an end to the painful rut that I am stuck in. I tell myself that I would never kill my self, because I would rather suffer every day of my life than cause pain to my family and friends. But I feel stuck. Empty, but so full of despair at the same time. Isolated, and alone. Constantly terrified. 

I can't even imagine myself having a future, and that's what scares me the most.

17 year old guy with loving parents in a good high school with a good education and a good monetary situation. People have always called me smart and whatnot, Ive done a series of jobs and freelance coding for companies like dell and hp and stuff. But my grades are garbage, i have taken 3 aps through high school annd like 5 honors. i have a 3.26 gpa and im working on improving it.

anyways sometime during sophomore year i started to find another escape to my problems in postponement and video games. sometime along i realized how fucking idiotic my methods were. ive always been a dark humor sarcasm kind of guy but i think somewhere i started meaning the ironic suicide jokes. but the thing is, i don't know if im just being a melodramatic bitch and need to toughen up. 

Im fairly insecure about looks and intellect, but not that much. I've never had a girlfriend, but i haven't tried and i'm not concerned nor insecure about that part i guess. I just don't know why the fuck I cant get my shit together when my parents both came from a poor neighborhood in india and worked 100x harder than i ever have to give me this opportunity and here i am wasting it spectacularly. college apps are coming up in two and a half weeks. I want to go to a good college. I think it will help. If I don't get into a good one I'm going to take a side project im doing with a friend full time.

Am I being a little bitch, ihave everything i could want in life except motivation. People tell me im smart and capable but I don't know why those are worth anything. 

to summarize, i think somewhere i realized ironic suicide jokes weren't just jokes anymore and sometimes i just want to end it but i love my parents too much. I think it's good my family has never owned a gun. Am I being a little bitch or what?

I am a teenager in high school and have a friend who is currently struggling with depression. There have been comments made about suicide, and I am worried. They have spoken to the school counselor, and their advice was to talk to a doctor and get medication. My friend says they cannot talk to their parents about this issue, and feels that their parents will not believe them or help them. Knowing them, this is probably true. Are there any services through which a teenager can access mental health professionals / medication without the consent or knowledge of their parents? We live in California, if that helps.

Something11222,5ey83u,1480141873,"No future, Why am I here?","Some background,
I'm a 24 year old overweight white cishet male (this is important) currently in school for graphics.

Every day I am bombarded by messages in mainstream media, in social media, in alternative media and elsewhere that I, being a white cishet man, am a demon incarnate.
I am failing terribly to do anything of note in my graphics program. I have no work ethic which stems from my absolute disillusionment with the program itself. I hate it but I'm too deep to change.
My body is betraying me, I'm type 1 diabetic and because of this I can't not be in school, I get benefits, otherwise I need to pay for drugs out of pocket which I can't afford. Cysts spring like grass on a warm spring's day from my skin and I need 3-5 surgical procedures a year to deal with them.
I've nearly given up on finding love. I was sexually manipulated by a woman for the entirety of my high school years which gave me a raging case of insecurity which is making it hard to find a partner. I did find a partner and lost my virginity to her but then she died on christmas eve 2 years ago. I miss her dearly. The woman who sexually manipulated me has recently wormed her way back into my life and, through convincing me that she's changed, has begun to do so again.
The only solace I have is two pet parrots whom I love dearly.

There are worse stories out there, but I still feel extremely inclined to end it all. I don't have a future. I am, as I am told, the devil incarnate. Love won't ever find me. My body shouldnt be alive.

nowhereleftohide,5fgl1b,1480393117,Can someone please help me. I have no one else to go to. I'm all alone.,"This is it. I feel like my days are numbered. One of these days I'm going to snap and blow my brains out. I just don't see the point in living anymore. I’ve been living with depression for 2 years now, and in that short time it has done a toll my sanity. Maybe this is the end of the road for me. Maybe this is the universe’s way of telling me that is time for me end it all. I've wanted to kill myself in the past but I've never made a plan or had the guts to go through with it. Everyday I beg for death, but nothing seems to happen.  I go to sleep and I wake up alive.





 My parents are always against me even when they claim that they aren't. A few weeks ago my sister told me that I'm a worthless piece of shit and I would be doing our parents a favor by killing myself . She says stuff like that to me all the time but I don't tell my parents because they favor my sisters over me and would either make excuses for her, or they would get mad and my sister would play the victim and get off. My dad asked me why I am rude to them and I told him that and he got somewhat mad at them but later asked me to forgot about it and try to get along with them. My mom didnt get mad at all and lied and said that she has heard me say the same thing to them. Sure, Ive said some mean things to them during fights, but Ive NEVER said anything like that to them. My other sister told me that I'm a pedophile and a pervert and that I like molesting children because I watch anime and sometimes it has little girls in it. Non of them are sexualized little girls.they are either side characters or one off characters. I’M NOT A PEDOPHILE OR A PERVERT OR A CHILD MOLESTER. My dad says things like let go  but tell me, if someone  said those kinds of things to you, would you ever forgive them? Wouldnt you rather just ignore them and have nothing to do with them? Could you be nice to them?




My mom is a liar. She always lies to my dad that I have rude tones with her and he just eats it up and yells at me. He so blinded by his love for her that he can't seem to grasp that she can lie. Its not like she my step mom, she is my biological mother. she always takes my sisters side. This one time my sister scratched me across the face and my glasses fell on the floor and she tried to crush them.  I pushed her away so she wouldn't crush them, as she was actively trying to do so. My sister then went to my mom and told her that I hit her. I tried to explain what happened but my mom kept asking why I hit her. I didnt hit her!  I just pushed her away. After we were sent to our rooms, I recorded my sister calling me a worthless piece of shit and showed it to my parents but they just shrugged it off. This other time my sister throw a picture frame at me and I got a pretty deep cut. It was one of those frame with sharp edges, Guess what? I got grounded and my sister got off scott free. My mom seems to ignore thing that happen right in front of her when my sisters are doing something, but when I reacted she goes after me.



Im just tired of this. I just want it end.I'm starting to think my sister is right. Maybe I am a worthless piece of shit."

 My best friend was the first to go. She started doing heroin against my warnings. A week after her first time trying it, she got a batch laced with fentanyl and elephant tranquilizers. I remember the last text I got from her... 

Next was someone I reconnected with at her service. I hadn't seen him in years, so we started hanging out and stuff again. He never told me he had a pill problem.. he probably knew I would have stopped talking to him... he overdosed a month after we got close again.

Two days before that, my friend from high school was on his way to work when his power steering went out while he was getting off the freeway. His car flipped and his neck snapped on impact. 

This year has been emotional torment. I said I couldn't handle any more losses. Then an hour ago, I get a call from my friends mother telling me that he lost his battle with cancer...

Aperiodformysentence,5eygb9,1480145953,"Writing my note..Unfinished, thoughts?","Suicide is something I have been giving a considerable amount of thought to as of late. If? How? What to leave behind and for whom. Notes and possessions, is that really all that’s left after it all?
What I do know is that this has all been hard for a long time, I am absolutely exhausted of life and when I really think about, I can trace it all back to when I was 14 or 15.

I know that after that moped accident, my mind does not work the same way that it used to. Early memories are not there, and while people tell me how intelligent I am, I know that I am not what I used to be. I don’t have those warm and fuzzy childhood memories that people seem to have in shadowboxes in their minds. Were they ever there to begin with? I suppose it’s only when you are older that you take time for that type of reflection and by then if you haven’t taken a net to those memories, maybe they disappear?

Looking at how my relationships have evolved with, and perceptions have changed of my parents through the years, I honestly don’t know what my childhood memories would look like. 

Mom, where are you? I don’t find myself talking to other people about you that much and I honestly think it’s because I don’t know who you are. Were we ever that close? Why did you think that walking away from the marriage, meant walking away from everyone? You left because you “couldn’t take the abuse” anymore, which I don’t fully buy, but what did you think leaving me alone with him would do for me? Did you care? Anthony was sent to jail, dad was heartbroken, and I was alone. To this day, you never make the effort. I see TV shows and movies where the characters make such a fuss about their mother calling and “bothering” them all the time, but adverse to their reactions, all I can think is: what a luxury. I never hear from mine unless she’s moving and needs help carrying furniture.

Dad, I know that you did the best that you could. I do. Bipolar Disorder has been your white whale as long as I have known you and while there has been a fair amount of struggle between us over the years, I can’t fault you for it. When mom left, it was just us and a few giant holes to fill in our lives and hearts. Anthony was in jail, losing his sanity, and there you and I were…. Seemingly 2 strangers sitting in a house that felt empty for so many reasons. You retreated into yourself and then to Cindy, both of which I understand. If the woman that I loved for 20+ years decided to leave in a puff of smoke and not to reappear for months on end, I don’t know what I would do.

I spent a lot of time alone in that house, sitting in that empty bedroom thinking about how it all went wrong. I was 15 and remember Mom talking about how important of a year it was supposed to be, and it turned out that she was right –if only in a way that she could never have imagined. That was the year that our family shattered.

[deleted],5fagrh,1480318861,Suicide is my only option now. (Vent),"I don't have anyone. I tried reaching out to multiple people lately only to be left on read and ignored. They know that I can see that they've purposefully ignored me, but they don't care. I don't know why I'm like this. I tried my hardest my whole life to be kind, generous, and to get people to like me. Im the type of person where I would do anything to make people like me, but it never works. Its never good enough, IM never good enough. I feel like from the day I was born I've had to fight just to keep up with every other kid but no matter how hard I fight, it's never enough. I'm not good enough, and I know this. I've been told by my dad how I'm worthless because I dropped out of school and now I only go two hours a week, so I'm home 24/7. The only friend I did have doesn't talk to me anymore. I can't fix any of the problems I have or the reasons for my depression and no amount of postive thinking, counselors, or meds will change that. This world is shit. Anyone who thinks otherwise is ignorant or living in their own little world where they don't have to deal with shit. Shit is all I've known. My older sister has always been favored, shes moved to college yet I'm still constantly compared to her. She's always been praised for her looks and meanwhile I had to deal with crying in my grandparents bathroom when I was 9 because my grandpa pointed out how I was fat and that wasn't the only time that's happened. Whenever i tell people about incidents like this or what fucked things people have said to me, I get called out as a liar right to  my face. It's happened multiple times. It's like people everywhere go out of their fucking way to make me feel like shit and beat me down, but once I'm fed up with it and want to end my shitty life im a bad person and deserve a guilt trip? I've been left out, shit on, and treated like a dog my whole life. I just wish I wasn't a coward. I hate myself, I hate other people, I'm never going to be loved. I'm a chubby, ugly white girl. I can't keep up with how much better everyone else is, I can't get a boyfriend and ill never be loved like all the other girls I know. I'll never be physically attractive to anyone. I have all the proof I need. It's not depression talking, I know I have no friends. I know how people truly feel about me because other people have told me. I can see how groups of guys will keep looking at me, whispering, and laughing when I'm in public. Strangers fucking hate me and I dont even have to speak for them to do so. I can't even go to the grocery store without someone staring at me looking scared or obviously talking shit about me to whoever they're with. I feel sub-human because I know that I am. My feelings are valid because I know the reality of my own life and the world I sadly ended up on. Life is not good, life is not fair, life is not fun or exciting. Im so angry at people who are in long happy relationships, people who are physically attractive, and people who don't have to deal with mental illness try to tell me to ""be happy"". Try being happy when you're a housebound loner with a fucked up face and on top of that has to deal with being mentally ill. I just wish I could get over my fear of death, if others can do it why can't I? I've seen 9 year olds who successfully commit suicide (I don't say that like it's a good thing, btw) but I'm 16 and im too big of a pussy? I've seen gore and just bad shit and I'm still scared of death and the afterlife (or lack thereof).

I've hired an exterminator and they've done many treatments, and I should be cleared this coming Tuesday, but the fact that I have to wait so long to go back to work is killing me inside.

But part of me really wants to do it right now. A big, intrusive scary part.

I don't want to talk to my friends about this; I use language that I think would put me in the bin right away. But I need to type this for me right now, this second.

I'm chronically ill and have gross medical problems that will stick with me forever, like my ostomy. I shit in a bag taped to my side. Like, no matter how great my life is I'll always have a shit bag. 

And that medical stuff is how I want to do it. I want to rent a hotel room, watch the lion king, and overdose. 

But I can't even rent a hotel room right now. I'm a financial burden to my family. I'm a fucking leech and a piece of sick poverty scum, trying to be independent and failing.  

I hate myself and what I do. I hate this. I just want to be a better person for the people around me, but I can't. 

I know ending it all would be devastating for them. I know it would shatter my friends and splinter my family. But it's like one big blow, and maybe some of them could use such a horrible thing to, I dunno, live their lives fuller or something. Instead I just suckle and leech and can't live up to their expectations. 

And I'm scared to seek help, because am I *really* in a dangerous place for myself? Like, I suspect if I talked to somebody all real like this there would be a welfare check on my in a heartbeat. And I can't fuck my family up like that. And I'd lose my deadend hand-to-mouth job that's hardly keeping me afloat and be an even BIGGER burden if I went away for awhile. I don't know how people get out of the hole.

I wish I had cancer instead of a chronic debilitating illness. I wish I had a deadline. Instead I have to grind through existing as me. 

I feel like a cosmic punishment, like I did something horrible in a past life. 

I want help. But I can't deal with the consequences of getting help. 

Am I addicted to getting taken care of? I've had so many hospital stays. I've had so many long surgeries with convalescence. This is just another way for me to check out. Yeah, this is probably part of a hospital malingering mental illness that stems out of being genuinely sick. I can't take care of myself. I'm a parasite. 

If I got my shit together I still shit in a bag, but maybe I would feel better. There are solvable problems here - they just don't feel solvable this second.

But I know some how I'm going to fuck this up and hurt people. I know that just by feeling this way I'm continuing a pattern of needing to be taken care of. I know by even typing this I'm upping the risk of anyone finding out and putting me away. I should delete this all and try to get back to climbing out of the hole. I should. I should. 

But I also know that despite the consequences, I need to get this out of me. 

Thanks. Sorry. "

Tonight, my best friend accused me of betraying them and sneaking behind their back. Said friend recently had a suicide attempt and I reached out to their partner because I was concerned about what they had told me about them still being suicidal. 

I am the bad guy though. I am the betrayer. 

I am tired of being hurt and hurting people when all I am trying to do is to love and help. I have too many emotions in such an overwhelming world. 

I myself have been suicidal for the last month at least. I have been self harming more frequently lately. 

Usually I would turn to friends but I feel so raw and torn up on the inside that I don't know who to talk to right now. I haven't been able to sleep more than a few hours at a time for a few days now. I'm burnt out. Exhausted. I have exams coming up and I don't have the mental capacity to concentrate.

Obsessingaboutdeath,5fm4ai,1480462436,Wanting to die: trying to be happy and don't see the point?,"Hello, 

I have been trying really hard to be happy. I work in healthcare and have done lots of therapy. I have tried medication already 

I have been fantasizing about death since age 12. I am a 33 year old woman.  I wish there was a store where you could go in and sign up for death. I feel like I am only staying alive just to make others happy.

People say I am professional, pretty and nice. But, I feel like life isn't worth living. I know this sounds odd, but I don't have much in my retirement account (I know I can work on it, but it's not up to the standards of others).  I am single, and there's criticism on needing to find someone. Trust me, I have had plenty of dates. No right fit. In fact, I have received a lot of criticism and emotional/verbal abuse my whole life. Years of being put down doesn't make you grow a thicker skin. It can make you feel like you want to disappear.   A client today told me that I wasn't the right fit for her.  I know these are all little things, but being dead means you don't have to put up with anymore. 

I don't feel like I was meant for the planet. I seriously wouldn't mind being dead.  

I am asking if you can give some rational logic to feel better?  I know people will be upset about my death, but for some reason I feel apathetic.  "

I feel like no one really cares about me. From my friends clearly hating me and finding my existence annoying, to my family who is only ever mad or using me, and my crush which to be honest probably has no reason to like me.

[deleted],5dwkfq,1479617955,I should kill myself now because I know for a FACT I'll never feel love.,"When I was really young my father would often get frustrated at things that annoyed or upset him, likely as a result of his abusive upbringing. This meant that if someone angered him he would go into fits of rage- throwing things, breaking things, shouting. I spent most of my formative years trying to be as quiet as possible. If I caught my father on a good day, my mother might still be the issue as she very much resented me. I was an accident, you see, and she was so upset at my conception that she smoked when she was pregnant with me. My birth defects were nothing I couldn't grow out of, but they gave my mother a very difficult challenge when raising me as I had terrible lung and stomach problems. None of my mother's ill-will is present in the case of my sister, however, who was a planned gem born two years before I and has never made a mistake in her life (hyperbole).

 *""Stay out of the way"" was the directive, I perceived, and I intended to follow it. Because of this, from ages 5-8 I spent my time in my room playing with action figures, making very sure not to actually touch them together in fear of parental retaliation. I rarely spoke unless to apologize for something i may or may not have done (my mother and father made sure to make me feel as though everything was my fault- *especially* their financial situation). I rarely ate because I was not served food and taking food from the fridge felt like stealing. I didn't want to upset anyone by accidentally eating their favorite food, anyway, so I didn't really see any problem with this situation growing up. I got lunch at school and some milk and any leftovers for dinner so I was happy enough, I suppose. 

Life continued like this for a while until my father's abuse got physical. At that point I outright refused to leave my room some days, school be damned. My mother was apathetic at best about my situation. When I was ten I got into the habit of listening to the family dinner through the wall of my bedroom and pretending I was at the table with them. While in reality my sister told a joke that made my parents laugh, in my head I was the one who told the joke.

Unfortunately all good things must come to an end. When I was 15 I tried to run away and upon being brought back home two days later my father beat me pretty badly. After that point he outright refused to see me and went out of his way to avoid me. He still is indifferent to my existence as far as I know. I am eighteen now and my parents are eager to send me off to college. I'm sure they don't plan on seeing me much after that...

Of course, that's just the backstory. That's right, we're only halfway through this mess! Now I'm going to talk about how fucked up I am in the brain as a result of a lifetime of misery. 

To begin, I'm a fucking idiot. Like, an actual idiot. Kevin levels of intelligence. Beyond stupid. I'm the dumbest motherfucker I have ever met, my hand to god. I constantly am walking into walls, corners, doors, shelves, cabinets, tables, chairs, you name it. If it's a solid object my stupid ass will run into it. I'm very bad at learning new things. I frequently forget and misplace things. My hearing is fine but I can't understand people when they speak. As in, someone will say something and it sometimes takes me like an entire two seconds to understand what they said. On top of all of that my dumb ass has short-term memory problems. The only reason I'm typing a coherent fucking sentence right now is because I'm using a thesaurus and trying as hard as I possibly can to sound even remotely intelligent (being seen as an idiot is one of my thousands of insecurities).

In addition to my stupidity, I'm a fat ugly pile of human fucking garbage so unsightly and atrocious that I literally have a face not even a mother could love. I'm 6'2 and have stress eaten my way up to two-hundred and twenty pounds. I'm a chubby, ugly piece of shit no girl is ever going to turn her head for (except to laugh or do a double-take to make sure they didn't see an ogre). I have a huge, bulbous, ugly nose, long eyelashes, skin more pale than is possible to create in any video game I've ever played, greasy cowlick-y hair and bad teeth on top of a terrible facial structure. Of course, I don't even have to mention the acne and freckles, because even without them I'd be hideous beyond belief. 

Let's see, what else, I'm shit at everything? That kind of goes along with intelligence but there is literally not a single talent, skill or whatever that I'm even remotely good at. I'm shit at everything, ruin everything and should be banned from everything. I have no commitment, meaning I can't go through with anything but that's okay because I have no motivation, meaning I can never start anything anyway. Not to mention that even if I'm committed and motivated, I have anger issues as well. I've also become loud and obnoxious because I got no attention as a kid, so even if someone is crazy enough to (1.) want to date a crazy guy, they'd also have to be willing to date someone that's (2.) clingy, (3.) constantly depressed, (4.) out of shape, (5.) 100% devoid of any skills or talents (6.) clueless of any social interaction, (7.) pretty much objectively ugly, (8.) fat, (9.) stupid as fuck and (10.) immature. To name a *few.*

Now, if you STILL are thick enough to not be convinced that I will die having never had a girlfriend much less having known the touch of a woman, here's the major kicker: a new girl started working at my job and she's very pretty. I saw her, got a rush of excitement and immediately shot myself the fuck down because I knew she'd hate me anyway. My exact thought was something along the lines of ""You're an ugly fucking loser and she's gorgeous, don't even fucking bother you have no chance with her. It's not worth the energy you fat piece of shit. Maybe if you lost some weight people would notice you, lardass."" I already have a crush on her. She probably hated me the second she looked at me. I'm so fucking ugly. I'm desperate for female attention but even if someone was kind enough to give it to me out of pity I'd just get attached. I got a crush on a middle-aged woman for holding the door open for me the other night. 

People at work call me Fred Flintstone because I'm fat and everyone there thinks I'm annoying, stupid and shit at my job anyway.

I've never felt loved, never will feel loved and will live the rest of my life in misery. Why not kill myself now? I regularly fantasize about myself being killed violently and when not doing so I'm usually reminding myself that no matter what anyone does I'll always be insignificant and worth nothing. I can't wait until I die. Then finally something I've done will cause joy in someone's life. I know there's no god because I've prayed for death for 18 years, so when I kill myself the pain will finally be over. Finally."
idonteatbugs04,5f2odf,1480207880,"people ""care"" if I die because they're morally anti-suicide but don't really care about ME","It's frustrating, because people will tell me how they don't want me to die... but last time I was in the ER alone for 7 hours before being admitted I realized people don't really care about ME. No matter who you are, even if you're amazing and successful and not a shitty human like I am, people are always going to care about themselves more than you. That's the truth of it.

This is MY fucking life. I'm the one who cares the most about it, and I decide when I want it to end. In the end, it's every person for themself. 

Fuck everything.

I still feel just as bad as I did then.  The only difference is, now I know specifically why I'm ugly.  My face is too wide, monstrously wide, and really no surgery that can fix it in any meaningful way.

When I was little, girls would ignore me and show attention to my friends.  When I got to middle school, I started getting called ugly and feeling ugly.  When I got to high school the bullying and name calling quadrupled.  I was too much of a pussy to fight back and too weak.  I spent my ENTIRE teen years behind a computer.  Literally, all my teen years.  Life has barely changed.  Now I'm in my 20s and still get called ugly when I go out and I still get ignored.  Nothing has changed.  Nothing will change.

MrWoodchuck34,5b8lta,1478325448,Just some thoughts,"Feeling pretty low as of late and on this cold Friday night alone I was once again brought into the dark thinking that is depression/suicide.

Then I found this and many other threads about such dark times and seeing so many people going through what I am going through is truly remarkable. I'm not sure whether to feel happy that I am not alone or sad that everyone else has to suffer the way that I do. 

I, as many others on this post I imagine, feel alone and am honestly tired of being told the same thing over and over. There's always highs and lows in life, but as of recent the highs I have now are what my lows were a mere 2 years ago.

That's why I'm posting here, it's appropriate if I want to gain anything from the comments.

Everything started after highschool circa 09'; I had a scholarship to study computer science at a major university. I was happy, fortunate and humble. I had a decent job for the time and a promising career; even though I was still an amateur at the time.

February 2010, 0400 hours I heard 7 loud knocks on the door. I opened the door and was dragged outside by the FBI guns blazing my family included. I was being investigated for computer hacking; 7 felonies with a maximum sentence of 20+ years in prison and over $1 million in fines.  I hacked into a government firm 2 years prior (age 17 at the time &amp; tried as an adult) under a collective called Anonymous. No damage was dealt other than keylogging more passwords and it was a simple break, enter, logout.

I was placed on pre-trial probation and awaited a court hearing for one year. During this time; my grades dramatically dropped and I only excelled in computer related classes. I would be full of lies if I didn't disclose that I thought about suicide but at this time in my life there was still a glimmer of hope, that in court I could defense my position; and I did.

The charges were reduced to 3 misdemeanors and 500 hours of community service. This happened one year after the Federal Raid. At this point in time I've dropped out out university and ducked social media because of embarrassment. 

4 years later my friends are finishing university and I'm still telling myself that I will save money and try to return to school. 2 more years pass and I'm writing this post; It's impossible to find a job, people think that I do drugs because I'm malnourished but I've never touched a drug in my life. I'm unemployed, homeless, and I'm writing this on my phone. It's 3:48am and it's cold outside. 

While I've been programming android applications &amp; games and posting them on the market; they've earned very little income (2,500 as of now) it's not enough to secure a place to stay or save for clothes.

I've honestly been dwindled to nothing.

I made this post because thinking of suicide is a welcoming thought; it's the first time in a long time that a crushing weight has been lifted from my chest and it's the first time that I can remember taking a deep breath.

Thank you for hearing me."
katurnberry,5ask4p,1478120772,"Have my helium tank, bag all made, and sitting on my bed ready for me.","I'm not quite ready, but this is the most secure I've ever felt about anything. Just to have the resource to make that choice when I am ready has given me a new breath. Not one to  make me reconsider where I will eventually end, but one to make my last days, however many they are, more enjoyable than the last several years.

I'm 24, separated from my wife(which is only headed towards divorce), have friends and family that I know love me unconditionally, but that isn't enough to fight the emotional, mental, and physical fatigue that I'm fighting daily. Where the only solace I have when I am not at home is daydreaming about being at home where I could end it if I wanted. I hate how talking about real depression sounds so dramatic, but it's exactly where I am, and where I have been since early on in high school. It sucks having a family that I know will back me up on anything. Parents who love me, and I have never had trouble landing a job. It sucks that my life doesn't appear ""worse"" from the outside so it would seem more justified. The things I have trouble with are not hating myself, finding even a sliver of joy in anything, and convincing myself I'm deserving of love. I've written a small note, and want to write individual letters to certain people as they deserve more than silence as I eventually go. I don't know what to say to my wife, I don't know what can be done to turn this around, and I don't know how to find the desire to turn it around at all. I want out. And this seems like the only outlet anonymous enough to express this and get something of substance in return rather than writing to just myself. "

I feel like going and doing things that I like, or talking to people that care about me is just procrastinating the inevitable. It's like not cleaning your room, you can go out and have fun but you'll always come home to it. I always come back to feeling like this.

I worked hard for a long time to build the life that I had, and I lost it all in few months. I lost everything financially, career wise. I'm stuck running a business that doesn't make enough money to support myself, living with family at 32 years old. 

I've been clean from drugs for 4 years, but I think every day about doing one last shot. The only thing that's stopping me is the fear of waking up from it and having to deal with all that shit again.

I think the worst part is that I really want help. I'd love to go to a doctor or something but I can't afford it. The healthcare system is awesome for the uninsured. And if I did I'm terrified of being sent away if I'm honest about my feelings with any doctor. I can't do anymore time in a facility. I won't do it again."

[deleted],5ed1b8,1479847024,Things Can Change...,"look guys, before i talk about what happened a few months ago, i want to talk about my past.

when i was a little kid, i had a decent upbringing, sure my parents were pot heads at the time, they still gave me everything i needed. things started getting hard around when i was 4, my dad has a really big accident on a motorcycle what almost ended his life, he had 32 fractures in one leg and he had a piece of metal go through his pelvis. the worst part of it all he was doing everything right.

i'm happy he survived but he had to go through so many surgeries, apparently i didn't cope too well when it happened as a kid. i was also made to be a lot more mature by my mum (since it was only her looking after me for a long time.)

i also didn't get to do many normal things what 4 year old would be doing. i also didn't get much bonding time with my dad either since he had to be in hospital for over a year (because of all the surgery) 

when i started school, i didn't really get along with many kids, i was always bullied in some sort of way. when i was in 3rd grade, i got group bashed by a bunch of kids to the point i was bleeding and i was continuously dragged along the ground until one of the teachers came around the corner. (i can still clearly remember)

i kept on getting bullied until around year 7 (start of high school) where i found a group of people i hanged out with, i even ended up getting a girlfriend. everything was looking great until my girlfriend of four months broke up with me. she was also in my group of friends and she put a really bad name in for me to my peers. i started getting into the wrong crowd and started doing drugs. i also started getting even more bullied my people in my year... because of the bullying i also started skipping school to do drugs. I was even starting to consider suicide but it wasn't a huge thought at the time.

around end of year 7, my parents found out (at this time they were straight edge.) they helped me get off the drugs, they weren't even that harsh on me... and were nice enough to even let me move schools too.

at this new school (or my current one) i was still getting a little bit picked on, not as much as my old school though. but i was still really down... a few months ago i was about to commit suicide because i was so over it... i was talking to this mob called 'beyond blue' about it. i told them everything and i said that i might do it tomorrow...

around 1 am in the morning, my parents got a knock on the door. it was the police and the ambulance, apparently i was classified very high risk of suicide. they wanted me to go to the hospital. i ended up going. the most shocking thing of all was that i realized people actually cared about me.... after around 5 hours i could go home since they re-assessed me and i was now classified as low risk.

i went home to have my parents give me a huge talk, they said that they were really sorry that they didn't even realize. my dad was also starting to break down and he told me that he feels like a failure, when at the time i felt like i was the failure not him... 

this time was the biggest changing point in my life so far, i finally realized how much my parents actually cared for me and i wanted to make them proud.

i started seeing a counselor every 2 weeks to check up on me, i also started going to the gym regularly because apparently it really helps ease depression and such. also i had a job around this time, not the best job, i was only getting payed 10 bucks a hour so i started saving up money... 

now and days, i'm living a better life, sure i still have my bad moments but not as bad as before. to this day i don't need to see a counselor anymore and i'm still going to the gym, it has made me feel so much better about myself overall...

i also eventually saved up enough for a car, yeah i know what you are probably thinking. i'm only 14... well this is mainly a project car.  i bought a commodore VX 2001 model only a few weeks ago for about 1,500 dollars. the only thing what is missing on it is that it has no sound system &amp; the seats are really damaged. which is a easy fix... i'm even thinking getting a better car eventually...

school has also become a lot easier overall. im  still not really hanging out with people my year but no one gives me much bullying. 

thank you guys for reading my post. i hope if you guys are in a bad way right now, that it gets better. 

edit: i also posted multiple times here about my suicidal thoughts and i just want to say thank you for everyone who supported me.   "
Pinecone121,5fpk7h,1480512084,"My birthday is on the 28th of March. If I don't have a job by then, and a chance to leave my parents...I may actually commit suicide.","My whole life, I've had a difficult relationship with my dad. It got to where every time I would talk to him, I would have to worry about having a breakdown, immbolizing me for a few days after.  

Hes been emotionally abusive as long as i can remember. Ive apways been scared of him. I decided, a few months ago, that enough was enough; he yelled at me for a nonexistent reason, without letting me speak, and ended the call with a snide remark about passing my test the first time, unlike my driving tests. 

I cut him off, and my mom understood. I did well; I passed the test (I also recently got my drivers license) and I had a few job offers, all of which but one are left. 

Nowadays, my mom is trying to get in touch with my dad to put me in education (more classes, studying abroad, etc.). I feel like such a spoiled brat complaining, but having to rely on him financially is what caused so much conflict and so many issues. It used to be pulling teeth to get him to pay my high school or university fees, or get my allowance; it used to be the main source of conflict, like this is how my dad would fuck with my mom, and this is how my mom would FORCE him to take responsibility (they're divorced). I think he's trying to make good on it, but...

I can't continue to live like this. I'm desperately trying to find a job, and following up with those I've already been speaking to. I don't want to have to rely on my parents; there's a whole thing behind it and my mind's a mess, and I know it feels like some spoiled millennial shit and I don't get to cry, but...I'm serious. 

As it is, I'm grappling with such a crippling inferiority complex because while my younger brother and I both got accepted into universities in Canada  (we lived in Dubai, I still do), he got to go. My dad held back for not 'being responsible enough' for no other reason than 'I don't make my bed'. My brother literally got to go while just being in his bedroom and being a dick to everyone the entire time. 

I've already been diagnosed with anxiety and depressive symptoms, and I just switched antidepressants because life finally looks good, and it's about to go to hell and I'll have to rely on my dad again, so YAY LET'S GET BACK ON THE SAM SHIT AND THAT WAY I CAN DIE EVEN FASTER 

I'm supposed to go to pole dancing, but I don't wanna style home and I don't feel like I deserve to have a fitness plan to keep my mental health in check. 

I've cried several times of the past few days. I've had this crisis a few months ago btw. Imy having it again. 

And that same deadline, 28th March 2017, is stuck in my head forever. "

If I can't find someone to be my friend I will expedite the process and kill myself."
apieceofpizza,5f72g9,1480275690,I wrote this last night after smoking a j and a blunt,"When I smoke I hear voices and feel like I'm losing my mind. I hear ringing and what sounds like my family fighting saying I should be kicked out. This has happened to me the last few times I've smoke and has left ripples in my normal life. I've lost my temper aggressively for no reason, I get intrusive thoughts wondering if I'll end up becoming a murder, if I could fuck some girl if I text her even though sex doesn't even really feel good to me. It sometimes became difficult to differentiate how I'm feeling on a personal and I often feel suicidal. Ive experienced derealization after smoking that felt like it bled a whole week. Its as if I feel have two personalities. I have the quiet me that thinks he's sweet and a good talker, then I become someone who thinks he's a detriment to life and that everyone hates him and is against him for a little bit. Ive been pondering this idea for a whole and before co caused I was bipolar. But when these voices appear when smoking and these thoughts race through my mind randomly I feel as if I'm just now developing schizophrenia. I'm 19 not going to school, working at a place I hate, im always tired, I basically lost all my friends and only play video games in work. So sometimes I focus on all the pathetic I think about within myself and feel depressed and lost. I can't tell if I'm only noticing that my mood and what feels like thoughts change randomly just because I recently smoked or if I'm going insane. I have a therapist and I have difficulty talking to him for whatever reason. I sometimes think it's anxiety and I don't want to tell him about myself, but then again I love talking about how lost and depressed I am to girls at party's and stuff? It feels like I'm on a wavelength and I'm currently switching personalities within myself and I think I may have that a small amount of that too when I'm not under the influence of weed. Its hard for me to recollect my memories well and I currently am having extreme difficulty just varying the thoughts to type this fluently. I feel as if I ask people the same questions when I see them, especially if I don't know them that well. I can't tell if that's because I got diagnosed with anxiety and have trouble talking to people or if that's just the persona I chose to use at that point. I also just space out. No thought so anything just staring. Then I think okay let's focus again and I knock knock back into the real world. I also decided to become a rapper out of the blue and my personality drastically changed and all my friends that I was genuinely crazy and basically stopped talking them to me once that happened. But then they still talk to me and ask me to visit whenever I want and such. I don't know if my music is bad because I've showed plenty of people and I've freestyled a lot and everyone has said I'm really good. I sometimes feel like I love it and I don't. I would want to spend my whole life making music and living a lavish life and then I'll think that I am absolute garbage and have no foreseeable future in music. It give some so much goddamn anxiety thinking I suck. If anyone's interested I'd love to get someone's feedback on a track. I've sadly lost motivation to try to have a future with music after like half a year and now I just work at Jimmy Johns. It depresses me and makes me feel like garbage when I think about how much a failure I am cause I'm not in college and I just work and live under my families roof. I also felt like my grandparents and other people in my family have schizophrenia and that I might have a higher chance of actually attaining the disease. My grandma is very mean and unreasonably stubborn and a complete hypocrite/liar. My grandpa goes from yelling at me over the absolutely smallest thing and then be at the same time be taking my garbage out of my room for me every night, washing the dishes without being asked, puts my clothes in the washer, and can have really genuine moments when he's kind. I literally came home today and asked if it was okay to park my car on the sidewalk, which my grandma replied to yes. I then asked well can I pull my mom's car into the garage then? My grandpa upstairs then in the middle of my sentence screams ""you better not park on the street or you'll get another ticket"". I start saying ""I know I'm going to ask mom for her keys so I can move the car"". My grandpa completely dodges my response and constantly repeats that I'll get a ticket if I park on the street. It gets so repetitive that I have to yell at him that ""I know, I'm asking mom if I can pull in her car!!. This happens often. He also asks me a question, then I'll clearly reply, and he'll ask me"" What?"" I can't tell if he's crazy or if doesn't hear me cause he's like almost 70 years old. My mom has been constantly talking about the guy she's went on a date with that night, with my grandma downstairs very loudly, or she's complaining about politics. I have 2 aunts who have schizophrenia and my grandpa got heavily abused by his dad as a kid, and that grandpa of mine seemed so kind my whole life. I actually didn't believe that he was abusive for a pretty decent amount of time until my grandma explained it to me sentimentally. My grandma has also told me she would leave my grandpa if she had the money, so who knows how she really feels. I do love listening to music thought. I write lyrics often and have around 200 memos on my android and like 40 memos on my iPhone of complete songs or lyrics. I get told I'm talented and some people when I ask if they enjoy it swiftly and confidently reply back ""I don't even like rap and really like your music."" I wish I believed in my music and worked on it all the time like I did before because I think I could make something with thiz. I then will sometimes think believing in my music is stupid and that I'll never make it because of both the difficulty a c because I feel I straight suck. I listen to music all the time thought. Especially when going to sleep. I've always had some sort of problems sleeping, usually consisting of me having racing thoughts throughout the night. But music calms that and makes me focus on it and sleeping. It shuts my mind up literally and puts me to sleep. I did it more often from a kid, up to hs, then I do now. I've always been good at English in school and I despise school. I hate sitting in a desk, having homework learning about all these things I have no interest in and will never make use of. And I would have to pay this by myself entirely, so is it worth even bothering with? I do then sometimes think that school is the only way I'll ever have success in life about. That in return, is smothered by self doubts in my abilities and how much I hate classes. See my problem? I can't have this unified person that is always fluid in his choices. I see so many people around me at work who seem to have such a consistent and reasonable personality. Like they're all in character and I'm just there. I have difficulty reading social cues as well along with responding to people during conversations as I would want to

Okay,  let's get straight to the points. 
1) I hate how I look.  I can look extremely HOT sometimes,  and sometimes really ugly for some reason. 
2) I'm a little bit overweight.  Not that someone can see it,  but I don't have the dream body I want. 
3) I am really awkward with girls.  I just am shy and don't know how to talk to them. 
4) I sometimes get bad grades,  but can get the full mark when I want to. 
5) My sense of humor is not very good. 
6) I live in Egypt..  I will always wish to move out,  but I'm only 13 years old. 
7) My parents don't really buy me some expensive stuff although they are quite rich..  Like for example,  my friend bought today a 10k L.E titan X,  which my parents refused to buy. 
8) I am not self confident at all. 
9) I am a Volleyball player.  Problem is,  I can be insane at the game sometimes,  and play like a new comer sometimes. 
10) This is one point that pisses me off..  I am one of the strongest in my school,  and when someone hits/annoys me,  I don't respond back as I'd rather not get detention etc. 
11) I am too nice to everyone.. 
12) I am scared of ghosts,  darkness,  etc.  I am sure they don't exist,  but It still scares me and I can't get over it.. 
Please answer each point if you really want to help me.  I am not considering suicide really,  but I am quite depressed. "
[deleted],5f7ghj,1480280022,Conflicted,"I'm 16. I have a two year old brother that I don't want to leave behind. That's the only thing that's making me hesitate. I don't have the pills yet, but Im going to take methotrexate (chemo pill). I don't know where I'm going to do it yet. I don't want my family to be the ones to find me. I just know I want to be out in nature by myself where things are quiet. I've got a couple letters written out, one to my only true best friend and the other for my mom. My moms will be the longest because I need her to understand. I have no friends, I sit at home all week talking to no one all day. I would make plans with people but I'm truly friendless. My only friend I mentioned above is graduating next month, and due to being in foster care, she has to move out of her foster home soon as she's 18 which is around the same time she's graduating. She's leaving town so I know I won't get to see her because im barely able to now. My mom's too busy for me. I stopped taking my zoloft because it made me sick and dizzy, my mood only improved for a month when I took them. By the end of that month, my emotions leveled out then eventually started going down hill and i started feeling worse and worse everyday. I'm at my lowest point, usually anger or stressful situations trigger suicidal thoughts, but now it's on my mind everyday. Even on my good days, it's like a shadow lurking around. I don't want help or to be talked out of it, I've made many cries for help and many people are aware of how I feel. They just don't care. The same people just tell me I need to stop being negative. Yesterday someone commented on one of my posts that I need to ""stop being a pessimist"" and ""if I want my life to change I need to get off my ass and change it"". This came from someone I've known since elementary but I don't talk to them and they're not a friend of mine, and of course like 5 other people who I'm friends with on facebook liked it as well. I'm angry at people. I'm angry for being treated like shit, I'm angry because I reach out and get ignored even when I just want to hangout for some company. I'm fucking despise the people who tell me to stop being negative when they have what I lack. It's easy to be positive and happy when youre life is going good, but I wish people would understand that just because you love your life and you're happy, doesn't mean every one else has to be happy and love life. Especially if you have something another person wants. I want to make people feel guilty and bad for me killing myself. I hate life and I hate them and I want them to know it. I want them to regret treating me like shit, I want them to know that how you treat other people has consequences, like suicide. I'm angry all the time. I'm angry myself at myself for being born looking the way I do, I'm angry at the world, society, and other people. I can't hear others have a conversation without my head throbbing and wanting to punch them in the throat. I got diagnosed years ago with major depression, unspecified anxiety, BDD, and I've recently began showing signs of bipolar or borderling personality. I live in a little shitty agriculture town in washington. There's no good counselors who can actually help you improve unless you want to drive all the way to seattle (or farther) and cough up $300+ for one session. I have no choice but to go to some shitty place on the 22nd of this month where the workers honestly don't really know what to do (I've gone to this place before) with people who have severe depression and disorders such as bipolar and borderline. I don't have a car, I can't get a job, I have no friends, I dropped out of school and now I do these work packets and only go to school 2 hours a week. If I don't kill myself, I've made the decision that I'll just start finding other drugs to do. I smoke weed all the time, I'm getting bored of it. I need something strong  but cheap. I don't want to be talked out of this, I just need to learn how to go through with it and accept it and to not be scared."

-I'm tired of not being as smart as tall people, since height has a direct relation with IQ. 

I don't see why I should put up with this bullshit, I'm going to have to work 4-5 times as hard as someone who is say 6ft. I won't be able to get a job as easily, I won't be able to make as much money IF I do get a job, and my chances of getting laid are low to none compared to someone taller.

TheMachiavellians,5f1n37,1480195031,I just wanted to feel loved.,"The fact that I'm posting here I already know there's a part of me that wants to live. I'm 17. I already know this is a rash decision for me but who cares. 
Ever since I started grade 9 my life went down hill. I'm white and brown. My dad has no back bone and let's my mother talk abuse shit to me any second she can get. No matter what I say in any conversation it because something negative to me. I've become suicidal and depressed since Grade 11 (I'm in Grade 12) as well I have anxiety attacks due to having stressed induced anxiety attacks. My parent's are Christian extremists who simply said ""pray"" it away. My parents never say I love you or anything anymore. I had shitty grade most of my life and I decided to pick them up. I went from 50's to 70's and 80's and I have only one 41. All my parents could say were how bad I am at school and that I'll never amount to anything. I'm tired  of everything. I have friends I'm not a loner I'm quite the extrovert. My life was at a point where I felt on top of the world. I had a job and I didn't have to see my parents at all because of it so I was happy. I'm a pathological liar and they know this. I can't quit lying I feel there is a necessity to lie to my parents because of how they blow everything out of proportion yet they claim I can tell them anything and when I have it ends up terribly. I smoke weed and I've been keeping it from them for a year or two now. They are slowly catching on. I smoke weed because it genuinely makes me not want to kill myself. 

When I told my parents about me being suicidal and having depression they made it about themselves and blamed said I was lying because mid terms were a week away and I didn't want them to be mad at my grades. I didn't intend on that at all. They made the situation about school and started calling me shitty names etc. I went to school the next day and my counselor whom I told first about it was baffled. I'm simply tired of not feeling loved by my parents. I want to move out but there's no place to move out to. My relatives won't take me in because they don't want problems with my parents. My grades started to slip because I simply have no motivation for anything anymore. I want to simply commit suicide but I'm afraid of the after life. Whether it be hell or complete nothingness. I can't do it anymore, I've held on for so long I a finger way from falling."

Sh3lf1sh,5ao0fd,1478060800,I just think life is pointless now,"It was going so good. Back in October, I started going to church again, I was finding God, and all was well. In June, my belief peaked, and now I'm one step back. I used to rationalize my purpose in life through God, even when I wanted to kill myself, but my doubt's gotten so bad I can't even use God now. I've done a lot of things in my 15 years, but it just feels like every thing has already been done before. I enjoy making music, but most good melodies have already been made, and used. I worked on many engineering teams, and we've done good stuff, but other people have done what we've done, but better. It just seems pointless to keep on going if nothing new happens. You could say that we're making advancements in electronics, but we're really just taking what we've already done and making it faster and smaller. Same thing with cars. Everything has been done, and it just makes me feel so useless."
razorh00f,5ao1xo,1478061405,i'm just getting tired of myself,"it's getting harder to live with myself lately. i'm a 27 year old male who still lives with his family, doesn't have a license, and lives with anxiety/depression and am on the spectrum. i have a job i like, and have been doing well at, but it's still just part-time work as an associate. i've gained a lot of weight in the past three years or so, and can't find the motivation to burn it off or diet because my depression and boredom gets so deep that sometimes eating is my go-to form of relief. i don't really have many friends, due in part to the whole ""living at home"" thing since my folks' house is in a shitty little dirt ball town, and i can't drive anywhere to escape it or meet up with people. i feel like such a colossal failure in pretty much every regard. 

on top of all that i really like a girl who i know i'm almost certain i don't have a chance with anymore, and even if i did? i'd still be a car-less, living-at-home loser with multiple disorders. who's gonna want to put up with that in a relationship? it's like...why even bother. Sure, I have good qualities too, I'm not totally ignorant of that. But ultimately i feel like they're severely outweighed by everything else. 

i'm trying to work on fixing this all right now but it gets overwhelming and starts to feel like i'll never sort myself out. every day at this point feels like another shovelful of dirt being thrown on the grave and i don't know how much fight i have left in me before i just give up completely. i've tried therapy before and it helped a bit at the time, I'm thinking of starting it up again. But who knows how much good it'll actually do in the long run. 

Mostly, I'm just tired of being so alone. It's physically painful at this point and I can't take it anymore. But I don't know where to go or what to do. "
scubafire4,5cnv80,1479003507,9 months in hell just to end up worse off.,"9 months ago i received a job offer half way across the country. After talking over the opportunity with my friends, I decided to do it. Turns out, It was the biggest mistake of my life. For 9 months i was stuck in a house unable to leave for 8 hours a day. when i could leave, it was dark and the local businesses wouldn't allow a minor in, so there was basically nothing to do.

 I never made a friend while there, i never saved any money because my boss fucked me over, i didnt get to do a single fun activity in one of the most ""exciting"" cities in the US, I was stuck in a house with minimal human contact for 9 months. I even tried to kill myself on my birthday after I didnt get one call or text from anyone. I spent my birthday crying and alone. But I kept telling myself ""it'll all be worth it when you get home"" and ""all your friends are waiting for you, it'll be great when i get home."" And i even had a female friend i had been texting while away that i thought things might get more serious with. things were genuinely looking good when i got back.

 So my 9 months in hell ends. i come home so excited for change, and everything is worse. My friends are all gone or busy, Things with my lady friend turned into an utter disaster, My family sold my car while i was gone and now i have to get another job to buy a new one, my paranoia is worse than ever. Basically im worse off than when i left and now i have nobody to turn to while im super down. I dont know what to do now. i have so much shit in front of me i can't motivate myself to do anything. I'm going nowhere in life. my life is just a stagnant pool of disappointment and failure and i dont see any reason to keep trying. "

kathrikat,5ffsvs,1480383524,I think I'm going to kill myself before my upcoming birthday...,"There is so much that has led this on, I don't know where to begin or how to explain. 

In the sixth grade, I tried to kill myself because I was being abused online and I had (and still have) emotional abuse at home. I self-harmed (I don't do it anymore but I do get urges), I completely fucked myself up by being self-destructive and never caring about myself, and it's just gotten worse and worse and worse. Plus my entire family makes me try to care for my grandparents but I can't even take care of myself so what the fuck am I supposed to do? I'm so behind in my classes I think I'm going to throw up. I used to be a straight-A student. Now I can't even do the things I like to do anymore(playing instruments, writing, drawing, singing, reading). 

The day before Halloween I (think I) was sexually assaulted by someone I thought had changed. God, I feel disgusting. I feel awful in my own skin. It was so..revolting, sickening, something worse than that. I don't know, I don't know. It makes me sick, it hurts. It hurts to see them every day. They pretend like nothing happened. Maybe nothing did. I don't know, but it doesn't feel right. I had to spend Halloween alone, crying by myself, on the verge of killing myself. All I had wanted was to trick or treat with my friends. 

My entire household is abusive and I've told my school counselors about it, but I have no clue when OCS is going to talk to me. I don't know what will happen to me. The rest of my family is too awful to stay with as well, and if my grandfather (the abusive one) gets taken away they are all going to hate me because I am literally taken their dad away. I don't want to live in a shelter. I don't want to be in foster care. I'm scared out of my mind. This house is driving me nuts. The yelling never stops, I can't really go anywhere. I constantly lie to my poor grandmother about where I'm at. God, I just hate being here. I jsut hate being.

My counselor said they put us in family counseling, but my grandfather can't be fixed. He can barely cooperate with his doctors. He's had so many strokes he can barely understand anything. He's stupid. Mean. Cruel.

I don't like my other family because we share completely different views, and they are VERY religious. If I told them who I really was (bi, trans, political views, mental illnesses such as depression, BPD etc, etc) they would hate me. And it's not like I'm noticed that much from them anyway, but what's worse, being hated, or not being recognized at all? I don't know I don't know I don't know. No one listens, no one notices me. I don't want to be hated either. I feel bad. I told my counselors about my dad (who was abusive as well) and I don't want my step sister to be hurt. I just want her to be safe. I hope she doesn't hate me. God, I don't want her to hate me.

My life is so sad I had to text my English teacher over this Thanksgiving break and ask him what I could do to get away. That's how sad it is. I felt so bad bothering him but God Bless him he is the kindest man I've met. Granted, he's one of the only people that's really been kind to me since I started high school, but still.

Please don't tell me it gets better. Every time someone has said that it has just gotten worse. Grandmother broke her hip in kindergarten. Bullying throughout elementary school. Losing the selectively mute friend I had. Bullying. Gain and lose, gain and lose, gain and lose. It only got worse. Nothing I love and need stays. Nothing stays.

I only have two friends in this entire highschool. One I think I may be in love with and the other is so sweet and kind to me. I'd hate to leave them before we get to celebrate my 15th birthday in December, but I don't know what to do. I hate all this waiting, it's driving me nuts. I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to kill myself, I really do. I feel like I have no other escape even if I have gotten help, it's just made things worse. I don't know what to do. I think I'm going to try to kill myself again before my upcoming birthday. I feel as though it's my only escape. I feel like people will finally notice me.

TL;DR: I just really want to kill myself before my birthday comes up and I'm scared"

peach-blossom,5dy9vf,1479652846,I read a poem today.,"It hit me hard. It made me want to live for a little while. Half an hour isn't long, but I thought it'd be worth posting just in case if it helps anyone else out there:

 The morning after I killed myself, I woke up.

I made myself breakfast in bed.
I added salt and pepper to my eggs and used my toast for a cheese and bacon sandwich. I squeezed a grapefruit into a juice glass. I scraped the ashes from the frying pan and rinsed the butter off the counter. I washed the dishes and folded the towels.

The morning after I killed myself, I fell in love. Not with the boy down the street or the middle school principal. Not with the everyday jogger or the grocer who always left the avocados out of the bag. I fell in love with my mother and the way she sat on the floor of my room holding each rock from my collection in her palms until they grew dark with sweat. I fell in love with my father down at the river as he placed my note into a bottle and sent it into the current. With my brother who once believed in unicorns but who now sat in his desk at school trying desperately to believe I still existed.

The morning after I killed myself, I walked the dog. I watched the way her tail twitched when a bird flew by or how her pace quickened at the sight of a cat. I saw the empty space in her eyes when she reached a stick and turned around to greet me so we could play catch but saw nothing but sky in my place. I stood by as strangers stroked her muzzle and she wilted beneath their touch like she did once for mine.

The morning after I killed myself, I went back to the neighbors’ yard where I left my footprints in concrete as a two year old and examined how they were already fading. I picked a few daylilies and pulled a few weeds and watched the elderly woman through her window as she read the paper with the news of my death. I saw her husband spit tobacco into the kitchen sink and bring her her daily medication.

The morning after I killed myself, I watched the sun come up. Each orange tree opened like a hand and the kid down the street pointed out a single red cloud to his mother.

The morning after I killed myself, I went back to that body in the morgue and tried to talk some sense into her. I told her about the avocados and the stepping stones, the river and her parents. I told her about the sunsets and the dog and the beach.

The morning after I killed myself, I tried to unkill myself, but couldn’t finish what I started.

Anomalicaris,5d1hso,1479198379,Planning Ahead,"If I've ever been good at anything, it's planning. I'm looking to get a few major things in order.

- Reestablish gainful employment. I'm a student now after quitting my job of many years. My resume is good, and I'm not worried. I can go get hired somewhere tomorrow if I wanted. Where I am struggling is with finding an excuse to quit school and return to work without making it too obvious why.
- Establish some sort of life insurance, which is my reason for working again. I definitely want to leave my husband with something. It's not his fault. I'm not even sure if cause of death affects payout. I'd be perfectly fine with taking special precautions to ensure he doesn't get screwed over.
- Getting out of my marriage. I'd rather just stay in it, but I cannot do that to him. He needs to fall out of love with me so I can be sure he's able to carry on afterwards. I'm just hoping I can hold on long enough for it to fall apart. My recent behavior is probably forcing it in this direction, even though it's been wholly unintentional.
- As petty as it sounds, I feel like I need to clean up my possessions. This helped a lot when I left work. I was able to let go when I felt like my loose ends were tied up. It was also a useful preparation that showed just how quickly we become irrelevant after we're gone.
- Withdraw. I'm already pretty cut off from family and friends, so this is probably the easiest thing. Ideally, nobody would really notice. It is essential that I free myself from obligation. 

It'll happen during one of my down spells, which come often enough. I have no doubt about that. Once a decision is made, it's rarely gone back on."
ErronBlack223,5cvxh3,1479130070,Never good enough,"that is something that keeps haunting me. i feel like im never good enough, i try my hardest, but its never enough. With my mom and dad and brother having acomplished such huge things i feel nothing next to them. like im not worthy to call myself with the same lasst name.

tw547,5cj85x,1478931257,Feeling lot worse lately and I want to talk.,"First of all, I'm sorry if English is off. I'm not a native English speaker.

I probably thought of committing suicide since I was 11 or 12, maybe even younger. It wasn't like my life was bad or anything, it wasn't a depression neither, I just didn't see the point of living. I first talked about thoughts of suicide with 2 of my friends back when I was in 8th grade and I was surprised to find out that it wasn't a normal thing to think of, until then I thought everyone had thought of committing suicide in their life. I think I started to have symptoms of minor depression in my high school. I wasn't always depressed, but I constantly thought of suicide. Still, it wasn't that bad. 

I graduated high school with honor, but I decided to enter community college since I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I still don't. There I met a girl. We fell in love quite fast, but she refused to actually date me because ""dating is complicated"", it was my first time having relationship like that, so I didn't really care, we loved each other, or at least I did. So we practically became a friends with benefit, this relationship lasted about 3 years, and she left me many times during that 3 years. She left me becasue she found herself a boyfriend. After what she had told me, she found herself a boyfriend. I couldn't even get mad at her becasue I wasn't her boyfriend. I was betrayed and used. Worst part is that she didn't even say bye to me, she just stopped talking to me completely. I probably wouldn't hate her this much if she gave me proper goodbye. I thought our relationship at least deserved that. I really loved her and trusted her. I even told her about my depression because I didn't want to hide anything from her. But that was just one sided feeling. There was many things that went wrong with that relationship, but that's a story for another time. Towards end of that relationship my depression got worse, and I started hurting myself really bad. I have quite few cut marks on my right upper arm and on my chest, and my left upper arm is just mess. I had to hurt myself, that was only way I could have survived, I might have actually died if I didn't do that. 

Now I have a job, nothing big, but it's a job. I have fun at that job and I enjoy spending time with my coworkers. I went out to eat with few of my coworkers few days ago, and it was great, I don't think I had that much fun in a while. But after I got home I started to feel depressed again, I started to feel guilty for having fun, and started to worry that times like that won't show up again. I help my coworkers a lot in my work, not because I'm a nice guy, but because it makes me feel better about myself. But lately it feels like they're taking my help for granted, they're starting to make obvious that I help them and call me a ""nice guy"". I hate it when people think that it's obvious that I help them. I'm not helping them for them, I'm helping them because I feel better doing it, if I don't feel good doing it, then I won't do it. I'm not a nice guy. I'm selfish. I'm so selfish that I disgust myself, it's pathetic. It's hard for me to smile at work lately, I'm very energetic guy at work, but lately it's hard to be energetic at work...

4 people knows about my depression. 2 of them which I don't talk anymore, 1 which made it worse, and last one is my best friend, but I don't want to bother him with my problem. He has his own issue. I want to die. I think about suicide everyday, and I think about her everyday too. I want to die, but I'm a coward. I don't want to say bye to my friends just yet, I want to spend more time with them, I want to talk with them more. I wish they think same about me, or at least be happy to see me. I hate myself, I wish I could just let go. If I keep talk to them, then they might actually get sad when I end it, I'm so selfish... I don't want a girlfriend. I don't think I can be in a relationship, I'm sure I'll love that person, but if it goes bad then I might actually kill myself.  I think I still want to live, but it hurts.... I hate this.  

I bought St. John's Wort at CVS today. I'll start taking it from tomorrow, maybe that'll make me feel better. I want to spend more time with my friends, even if it's just a day more. I'm sorry for a long post and terrible English. Thank you for reading, I think there's more things that I want to say, but these is all I can think of right now. I haven't let things out like this in a long time, so it feels good. Again, thank you very much for reading.

I hate it when people tell me that, just wait it out, it'll get better in time! No ok! Hold your best friend in your arms, the one fucking person who helped you through the torture of having everyone hate you, and then tell me ""just wait it'll get better!""

And that is just the tip of the damn iceberg. My brother, who's perfection incarnate, makes me hate myself even more. I feel like I'm standing next to a bright ball of sunlight and I'm just a tiny little candle. He is perfect in every possible way and I am just so not. This family would be so much happier without me. It would literally be the perfect family had I not been born. I am such a waste. 

And you know what I hate the most? Feeling that the only solution is to die. I DON'T WANT TO DIE OK!? I don't! But right now (and for the past several months) it seems like the only solution! I can't see any way out of this! It's all just darkness ahead of me and darkness behind me. I just want to end it all before things really nose dive."

totallyconfused84,5btj0w,1478615748,"Help me please, I don't know how to live anymore","I (guy, begin 30's) tried so much but I just can't get out of this suffering. Yesterday I've been drinking and at this moment I have a hangover combined with suicidal thoughts, so I called in sick at a job that I hate just to lay in bed and watch some sick porn to numb the mental pain.

I suffer from social anxiety when it comes to speaking in a group; gets me panic attacks. I'm very anxious at work too. I've always been anxious and drinking has always been my 'remedy'. I tried to quit many times, but I just keep going in this cycle. My father actually encourages me do drink (ridicules me when I don't) and I think that's because he has many issues of his own which includes drinking. My family is just ****** up, social circle is very much decreased and recently I broke up with my ex-girlfriend. My youth was traumatic, I hate myself and when I suffer too much pain I watch porn.

It's cold outside. I realise I've just nothing to live for anymore. Nothing. I'm depressed, anxious and I want to leave or die. I dream about leaving this place, this city, this country, just to start a new life away from the booze, away from the ****** up people, away from everything. Sometimes I even fantasize about converting to a religion of some kind hoping that this will give me peace, since I love reading about philosophy and spirituality. But too many times I simply think about jumping in front of a train.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I just want out. Out, out, out. I want to run away from all the bad memories of the past, the people, everything. I want to let it all go, let it all slip. I just want peace."

I can't go to a therapist without a car and insurance. I can't stand being alone and feeling like my family already forgot about me when I moved away. I've always been a burden. I might as well have been an accident. I don't feel like I belong anywhere. Not only that but I am trans and my gender is just one more obstacle to me. One that I also can't do anything about. I've tried religions. I can't connect. No one connects to me. They all just see me as troubled.
Captcha_Code,5c239v,1478709359,I'm alone and financially ruined and my baby is dead. Just ready to shoot myself.,"Had a miscarriage. Boyfriend left me. Told me he'd move in and be emotionally supporting if I had an abortion. I didn't want an abortion but miscarried. He left me because he didn't want kids and could see I did. Now there's no one here to help me and I can't tell my parents because of religious shame. 

He's not moving in and I'm in so much debt and it keeps piling on and I'm going to be financially ruined by this time next year. It all relied on him moving in. 

My baby is dead and that could have kept me going because I wouldn't be alone. But now I'm alone and my boyfriend is gone. 

My therapist hasn't been much help lately as far as helping me calm these feelings. They're so extreme and I don't know what to do. 

The only thing keeping me from going and shooting myself today is my dog. I'm all she has and my parents wouldn't take care of her the way I do. But I'm so close to just saying fuck it. This depression and loneliness and regret and fear isn't worth it. 

I am alone. I have nothing. No one. I have never been this miserable in my life and I have been quite miserable before. Thinking about suicide has always been more like a fantasy but it feels real this time. 

I'm so alone. "

I feel gross just acknowledging it, but my entire life has been a lie. I've apparently been repressing my homosexuality unbeknownst to myself. I have no desire to spend my life with another man. I think about how I will never know what its truly like to love a women, to feel that natural attraction. Why have I been deprived of this basic meaning of life? I've struggled through so much in my life that to come to this understanding means that I truly have no purpose. I know none of you will miss another homophobic loser but there really are people out there that don't want to be this way. Why is that so hard to believe? By exact definition homosexuality is a disease. Its a condition that causes abnormality, distress, social problems and will soon enough  be the reason for my death. How is that not considered a disease?We say it ins't just to spare the feelings of others? Since when does anyone genuinely care about anyone else? Would you tell someone with a brain tumor that they should just embrace it? No.You wouldn't.


I don't blame you for hating me after reading that, because I certainly hate myself. I just had to fucking write this. I don't know how long these thoughts will be around for.

I have stopped taking any meds two months ago because of how they make me feel, so keep in mind I wasn't in a good place to begin with, already inches from swallowing all 19 bottles of pills I have.

A few weeks ago I was encouraged to apply for a promotion at my work, and I interviewed really well, according to the interviewer after I asked later on. He even had me do acting supervisor for a few days while no supervisors were available. So I was told by the other supervisors they are 100% sure that means I got it. Get in to work today and check my email, to find complete utter denial. No explanation. Nobody else applied for the position. Tonight I am taking all of those pills I've saved up. 

I'm worthless. I'm 100% worthless. I don't deserve to live. I have nobody. I have severe PTSD from being raped in the military twice, and once after I got out a few months later and given HIV (25 yr old male btw). I don't want to keep living. Maybe I'll swallow those pills. Maybe I'll jump in front of a train. Maybe I'll even just bleed out. I only have ten years left to live anyways. Nobody would care. "
McBambi,5b0pqp,1478221340,I feel hopeless.,"Hey, I'm a sophomore at a private high school, and I'm in a really bad spot. It's not a social problem at all, I love everyone and I'm going on a date with a girl who I think is amazing this weekend. The real problem is I hang out with probably the smartest people (my age) in the state and I'm a really shitty student who at the moment has three F's and two D's. I've been having trouble thinking of my future and I tried to kill myself yesterday with a belt in my room, I backed out because for some reason I thought my useless procrastinating mind could make it in this world. The second quarter of my school year started a week ago, and I don't know what I can do. My parents know I'm depressed but I just keep telling them, ""I've got this, leave me alone so I can fix this."" And then the vicious cycle starts again leaving me with worse grades. My question is, with where my grades are at right now and looking at the time in the year, do I still have a chance to bring it back? I don't want to leave this school or this world, I just don't want to live in shame knowing that I screwed myself in the first place."

me8099,5be6ab,1478406556,I'm Done.,"This will be my very first and very last post. Writing calms me down, and is a very soothing way to release my feelings. This is not a cry for help. This is not a misguided rant about why my life sucks. This is just simply a purging of emotions expressed in a pretty well thought out blog piece. I, at age 36, have decided to end my life. 

Yes, there is a part of me that wishes to continue living. However, that part is now strongly muted by what I see as reality and reason. It just makes so much sense to stop it. Right here. Right now. Every time I try to motivate myself to keep going, reason kicks in. ""Oh, but it'll get better."", is what I keep telling myself. Then, reality hits me. It won't get better. Life isn't worth the pain. Life isn't worth the fighting. Life just simply isn't worth it anymore. I don't have it within me to keep going. 

Looking back and studying the pattern of my life, I've come to the conclusion that life doesn't get better. Either you get stronger or you do what I've done...you break. It's very sobering to come to the end of your life and realize that this is all for nothing. Existence. Trials. What is it all for? Why is this existence so hard and wrong? Where is this ""god"" everyone says is in space...somewhere? At what point is it gonna come down and straighten all of this out? None of this can be rationally answered, which means that none of it has any meaning. So...here I sit. Alone. Heartbroken. Confused. Angry.

Life is not a gift. Life is a series of unfortunate events. Life is the concoction of some malevolent force in the universe that enjoys and is pleased by suffering, pain, and hopelessness. That has been my journey. I never asked to be born into a loveless family. I never asked for my father to leave. I never asked for my mother to regret having me. I never asked for my siblings to resent me. I never asked to be abused by stepdad after stepdad. I never asked to be hated by every single person on the planet. I never asked to be overweight. I never asked to be a failure and a loser. I never asked for any of this. Yet, this life deems it necessary that I watch every living thing enjoy this experience...sometimes at my expense. Whatever it is that is in control of my life, it sure has beaten me down to the point where I can no longer take the suffering and the losing. I can not live another day broke. I can't live in constant fear of homelessness, unemployment, and hunger. I can't go on like this. So, I've decided to let go of it all. 

No one is gonna miss me. No one knows me. No one cares to know me. It's like life just set me here and made me noticeable enough to ignore, ridicule, and hate. Yet, I was raised to believe that I'm supposed to give thanks to whatever it is that gave me life in this hell of an existence...all while watching everyone around me experience love, joy, comfort, happiness...the things that I was told that make life. Yet, I've experienced only loneliness, sadness, emptiness, resentment, and hate. You know, it really does suck to grow up, have certain tastes conditioned within you, then have life and circumstances work to where you can never ever satisfy nor experience those things. It sucks to love a woman so much, yet she doesn't even know or care that you're alive. It sucks wanting friendship so much, but no one is interested in getting to know you. It sucks to want someone to talk to and no one is there. It sucks to want to be close to your family, but they hate you. It sucks to wish that you were loved by a woman as much as you love her. It sucks to be fired from a job simply because someone doesn't like you...not your skill, not your attendance...but because someone just doesn't like you. It sucks to be in the same world as everyone else, yet on the outside looking in. Life just sucks. There's no point in going on. Life doesn't get any better. So, I'm gonna end it. The universe will have to find some other being to kick around and hurt, because I won't be here anymore. I don't know what lies beyond the final bout of pain that I'm about to feel. However, I do know that it won't be this. I just hope that life isn't a true circle and I don't have to come back here nor anywhere else. I hope the universe, god, whatever/whomever the architect of this existence is...just simply let's me go. I don't want to come back as anything nor anyone else. I don't want to exist. I just want the pain to go away. If this could be any different, I'd probably be compelled to stay. However, it will not get better. If you've happened upon this piece, then my hope for you is that your life isn't nearly as bad as mine. I'll never encourage taking your own life, because you may have something beautiful to look forward to. I can only express ending mine because I know that it will not get better. I have nothing to look forward to except more suffering, pain, and hurt. I'm done letting life do this to me. I have no other people who will be hurt by my passing. Therefore, I can leave this earth and existence with a clear conscience and embrace whatever's coming after this. I just hope it's not more life. "
cansadosinesperanza,5ccv6s,1478842281,The reason I am ready to die,"I think I’ve figured out my problem.  I doubt that means much can be done about it, yet I’ve figured it out.  I hate myself to the point of being suicidal.  I’ve been suicidal for years.  I’ve attempted.  I’ve done the hospital thing, the outpatient thing, the counseling, all of it….and I’m still suicidal and I still hate myself.  Not just the little innocent self-loathing that we all do from time to time but truly hate myself.  I see my veins and think they shouldn’t be filled with blood.  They should be empty.  Someone like me doesn’t deserve to have blood in their body.  I go to the salon for a haircut and do everything I can to avoid the mirrors all around.  I listen to the things I say and realize I’m the odd man of the group.  The one people tolerate but don’t really like.  

But wait, don’t tell anyone!  They’ll assume you’re fishing for compliments.  Or they’ll agree.  Or maybe they’ll assume you’re trying to manipulate them.  How can it be manipulation when it’s forceful enough for me to plan my own death?  But I can’t say that.  They won’t understand that.  Everyone has doubts but they get their shit together and shut up about it.  Not me.  Pathetic inside and out.  Isn’t it about time for it to end?

[deleted],5fgyjm,1480398082,Not Sure About Much,"So I'm relatively high-functioning as a depressed person (currently attending college, getting okay grades), but that's more or less because I don't want people around me to be tipped off to something being wrong. I've been depressed for 6 years, wanting to die for about 2 years, and this past year I decided that I would go through with it sometime in January 2017. I've already done pretty well at isolating myself from friends (I hardly talk to anyone at all anymore), and I'm just hoping I go through with it. I don't want to change my behavior for the ""better"" if that makes me change my mind, does that make sense? As long as I continue self-sabatoging, then I'm on the clear path to where I'm hoping to go.

My ex (of 5 years) messaged me last night about the upcoming Spirited Away screenings in U.S. theaters Sunday December 4th [check theaters near you, hopefully you got something useful from all of this], after we had been on ""no contact"" for about a 8 months. He's the only person I've ever talked about my suicidal urges with, and overall I managed to sort of kill that relationship. We both effectively cheated on each other at some point. But two pretty critical things in all this are 1) for all the bad stuff, he's a completely honest guy, and (I don't know how to effectively convey this in a way that doesn't make me seem blinded) he considers me to be the love of his life. He hasn't dated anyone since our official break-up two years ago; honestly, I would be happier if he had, because 2) I never felt the same way about him and that lack of being able to reciprocate really fucked me up (he was not ever abusive, I was/am abusive towards myself).

All of this is to say that I'm stubbornly approaching the day I die, while also isolating myself and keeping my distance from my ex. I think about killing myself, and I think about my ex, nearly every day. And I'm not sure if one is negative while the other is positive, like killing myself = bad, but reminding myself not to talk to my ex anymore = good. I keep having this asshole fantasy that I call him the night I'm gonna die, because then he can come over and keep me safe from myself (again, yeah, I realize this is a trash thing to consider for his sake, because it could literally fuck him up for life), and then once I'm done realizing what an asshole thing that is to do I'm back to thinking ""yeah it's gonna be way healthier for everyone involved if I'm dead, then nobody has to deal with my self-sabatoging asshole behavior + 100,000 other reasons I need to die""

He doesn't deserve to be ""the only reason I'm still alive"" because I don't know what kind of burden that would place on him. Not to mention that, as long as I'm not dead, I'm going to be subtly continuing my self hatred in the hopes that I DO go through with it someday, and that's going to continue to influence my interactions with everyone and my ability to function day-to-day."

I told my father today that I couldn't wait for the day I died, that I wished I had cancer, that I envied my uncle who recently died from bone cancer (we weren't close so I didn't effect me). He thought I was joking, he laughed and joked that I would need to go see help then, we both laughed it off but I was completely serious. I really wish I was dying, there is something comforting in knowing that i'll eventually die, I don't understand the people who want to live forever, I can barely go a whole day without breaking down holding a knife to my throat and saying to myself over and over again that I should just do it already. 

Lately I have searching for contacts for heroin and other opiates because i'll probably just try to overdose on those, if I had cancer or something I would probably be able just to get them prescribed and then I could kill myself more quickly. "

Girls my age already have children, careers, successful lives while I'm here mooching off from my parents AHAHAHAHA I hate society I hate everyone I hate how my ""friends"" fucking left me alone crying on Halloween and I fucking hate how jealous I am of everybody 

I'm a fucking failure I failed my parents and I've posted so many times on this fucking website hoping and just hoping things would get better but never mind that, society only cares about if you have a job or if you're in school, because nobody likes a bum 

I'm sorry I'm a bum that's why I'm a reclusive NEET and I hide away from the world, I'm sorry I can never be normal and be some delusional weeb clinging onto a fantasy world too afraid to confront reality holy fuck I'm so fucking angry is it only really about how your occupation is??? is that it in this society, just superficial bullshit that won't matter in the grand scheme of things?? 

I fucking hate los angeles, I feel so trapped but because I live with my parents, I fucking know I have nowhere else to go 

Just go be a bum hahahah 
I used to be a cute and young cosplay girl what the hell is wrong with me what the hell is wrong with me oh thats right I fell in love with a guy who I thought would fix my every problem but nope, it just made things worse 

I'm scum I'm fucking scum I don't want to contribute to society, I'm an ugly old hag and I'm bitter, jaded, lonely, depressed 

I'm going to go see my therapist at 11 AM but she's some super attractive thin therapist lady who I feel like she'll never understand me, her targets is on latino clients so yes, I felt like she would understand me but of course, it's not like I'm actually a latina- hahaha I may look like it, but I act like an American on the inside even though I'm a fucking disgusting weeb who can't seem to assimilate to my culture easily I can never seem to trust mental health professionals hahahaha I'm a lost fucking case, my thoughts are so incoherent 

all of my friends secretly resent me, and they tell me, "" oh it's because of our busy schedules, we have jobs, we don't exactly have free time haha"" so yeah, it just constantly made me feel inferior and unwanted fuck this shit, whenever I step out people look at me in disgust and I feel so ashamed, being trapped in this room is the only solace and comfort I have, I don't want to leave this room 

I'm so lonely, but beggars can't be choosers I'm basically a glorified bum living with my parents not interested in going into a career, I fucking hate the concept of money, my ex only stayed with me because I was his meal ticket and because I had money, that makes me sick I hate the concept of money so much why was I so stupid to think I would make an impact on society 

I want to die I want to die I want to die but I'm too scared of death but it's the best thing to do- I'm so shameful lol, what the fuck is wrong with me I'm too prideful for a low wage job welp my parents wanted me to get a job that wasn't as horrible as theirs, I'm a failure I'm sorry mom and dad I hate myself I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm so weak I'm so lonely I used to write articulate, very profound writing but now it's just an endless stream of jargon I'm so angry right now, angry, so much pressure, but I'm also underachieving and a failure, self-fulfilling prophecy hahahaha 

I'm so bitter and irresponsible I'm glad I don't have kids I can't even take care of myself fuck having depression, fuck having anxiety, fuck having social anxiety and all of these crippling illnesses, it's universal, everybody has these thoughts, so I don't have an excuse to be a fucking loser right 

I'm so fucking weak I run away from everything because I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm SCARED CANT YOU SEE IM SCARED AND IM SO FUCKING SENSITIVE TO THE TINIEST OF INSULTS I FUCKING HATE HOW WEAK I AM MY EX HATED IT ""I'm attracted to confidence"" hhahahaha sorry I guess you won't be attracted to me then 

I would give anything in the world to be high-functioning, and to have the galls to successfully get a job and maintain it while being sane at the time so I wouldn't be a fucking failure to my family 

and don't fucking tell me to get a job, because I went on 7cups and a listener laughed at me for being a ""bum"" and that all of my problems would be fixed if I just get a job and seduced a guy, oh wow, really, all of my fucking problems will be fixed if I seduce a guy and be treated like a sex object, thanks "

Recently I've started to think about suicide and how it would help me get away from everything. I don't have any emotions except being sad and angry. Today someone walked in front of my car when I was driving and as he kept walking and flipped me off I could only think about how I wished I had actually hit him. People don't follow through with plans with me anymore, I am failing all of my classes and I can't do anything right. It's seems like everything will be better if I just end things. No more worries. No more thinking about my problems or how I'm a mess. Just me alone, not being a burden anymore. For a few weeks now I've felt like I have depression, but I don't know what to do about it.

BobdanQ,5er6cg,1480039423,"Two weeks ago my wife said she'd never leave me, last week she did.","Apologies, I have been drinking, I hope this reads well.
Last Tuesday my wife came home from her new job. 
She sat me down and told me she is no longer in love with me. She still loves me me, but is no longer in love with me and it is the end of our relationship. Our 13 year relationship, our 5 year marriage. 
2 weeks ago I had a nightmare where she left me, I told her and she said she would never leave me.
We have both have mental health problems throughout our relationship (depression, anxiety), but have always been there for each other.
She says she can no longer look after me. I dont want looking after.
Things havent been wonderful of late, but far from awful. 
She says she has been feeling this way for a while, but instead of talking things through with me, she has been going to see a friend and having all the conversations with her, so I havent even had an input in the thoughts, conversations and events leadig to this point.
As I said we have both suffered with mental health problems and as such most of our relationship has been just us, few friends, no family her side (she was abused as a child and so has no contact) and we have kept my family at arms length.
It has just been us two.
She has been all I have had, she is my life, my everything and I dont understand why she doesnt want me anymore. Why she wont even give me a chance to sort the problems we have.

She asked me to give her space so I moved out for 2 weeks, even though she is the one wanting to end it. I have moved away from her and my family. To some they may just be pets, but to me they are family and i miss them dearly, particularly our dog Tilly.

I feel like everything has been ripped from under me.
Two weeks ago things seemed fine, now I feel like I have nothing. All I want is her. If I cant have her I dont want to live.
I have been with my sister since, who is in the mental health care profession. She has been making sure I do nothing stupid these 2 weeks.
I have been trying to keep so strong. I have improved on who I am so much in these 2 weeks, but it has been for her.
If, when I see her to talk things through on Saturday, she says it is over I dont want to live. I
I dont see life without her.
It has been me and her for 13 years though thick and thin and thic and more thick.
She was my first and to now my only. I have no friends. I dont know how to meet people. I dont know how to date. The idea of being with someone else sickens me. I'm distraught and crushed. 
I Still want to be with her whatever it takes. I dont think I will get the chance.
I am seeing a therapist but it's not even close to enough.
I am on Diazepam but its not nearly enough.

Two weeks ago she said she'd never leave me. Last week she did.

Sorry if this doesnt have much order I'm a bit all over the place.

My context is I've been dealing with suicidal depression and anxiety off and on (mostly on) for seven years now, with therapy and drugs and all that jazz. And though I have undoubtedly had happy - even very happy experiences few and far between, the lows of my health (both physical and mental) make nearly any pleasurable experience seem not worth the rest of the bad stuff. So, I'd like to hear others' perspectives, especially those who've found meaning in life even after having dealt with depression or extreme loneliness and isolation (which is another aspect of my current experiences). Thank you in advance for your time. I'm hoping hearing others' thoughts will help pull me out of the really awful suicidal place I'm in right now.

PickAHorseshoe,5e1phj,1479695806,Not sure if it's worth it...,"I'll explain what I mean.

I'm at a position right now where I can improve the quality of my life but don't feel like I should. The entirety of my life has completely unraveled towards recreations that include alcohol abuse, a stint of prostitution, shallow friendships, and destructive romantic relationships. This year I turned 25 and voluntarily committed myself to a behavioral psych ward one week before my birthday. I left work early one day after a particularly stressful morning filled with whispers about my lax in productivity and drove my shaking and hazy self to the emergency room to tell them I thought about jumping off the building at work.

I got on antidepressants for the first time in my life and tried going to group therapy one week after I was released (but stopped going a short time in). I'm an irresponsible and angry person down to my core. I do understand a lot of people aren't completely without faults but I view myself as a fault. In fact, my past mistakes make me feel like I'm tainted in a way. Like, my sins have made me unable to connect with seemingly 'normal' people. I don't feel like I have many things in common with the people in my day-to-day life. I've had FOUR jobs in these past six months and quit after a week at each one of them. I left my own place to move back in with my alcoholic and childish mother who grates on my nerves. I sometimes think I'm just on a path to end up like her.

But lately I've found work as a seasonal worker at a department store and use that to make ends meet. I've been looking for a second job to help my finances and for me to move away from my mother. Everything was okay for these past two weeks until I called-in to work yesterday and today. My old habits have come back and I'm just going to end back up sabotaging myself to unemployment and mental anguish. I sometimes sit and for wonder if I'll ever learn to be a successful member of society? Will I just live a life being paranoid and irritated by daily responsibilities and fear of being with other people? I have thought about killing myself for around three years lately. Ever since I dropped out of high school, I've lived an aimless life. I'm from a poor family from the housing projects so I've never really experienced the atmosphere of stability or success. I don't know if I want to continue living a life with no prospects. It feels like people tell me 'it's okay' and 'things will pass' when they don't realize how tired and confused I am. I took some of my mother's prescription pills in her cabinet to try and sleep the day away today. I think about taking a handful of them to get it over with. I mean, my logic has become that 'I'm going to die eventually so why not just do it now? Things are not going to improve; they never do.'

Any comments are fine. I don't feel anything right now."

I just want to say that today things look a lot less bleak. I never realised things could get that bad. I've felt depressed before but have never had intense suicidal thoughts like these. I could easily have taken my own life on a whim if I'd kept drinking.

So I'd like to thank the people on here who responded, as well as the suicide line I rang that night. If I hadn't spoken to someone I wouldn't have gone to my doctor, who wouldn't have organised a visit by a crisis prevention team, I wouldn't have seen a psychiatrist and I wouldn't have gone back to AA.

I've read a lot of posts on here, and I empathise with all of you. I don't feel like I'm able to help much at the moment but I'd like to come back later as a responder. I never knew things could get that dark, and I hope I never go there again.

I would just like to know how I can save my family any extra trouble. The private school loans are in my name only. I have federal loans which are in my name only(I assume).

I have ~$6000 in a 401K.

I have a few hundred on a credit card and a few hundred more in a checking account.

Is there anything I need to handle before it's done? As far as I know my parents are immune to my debt since they didn't cosign the private loans.

I need to find a clean way to do it. So i'm not disfigured after.

I'm trying to spend time with the family so that they will have some good memories at least.

What else can I do?"

advisoryangel,5e27tx,1479702733,Has anyone ever recovered from BDD? I can't see a way out.,"Hi there, I'm hoping someone can give me some advice. 

I have Body Dysmorphic Disorder - I call it this because I believe I accurately percieve my appearance but my negative opinion on my appearance consumes every waking moment of my life and has driven me to  try and kill myself 3 times over the last 10 years which is definitely not normal. I'm 27/F. My BDD is not specific to one flaw, about me everything is wrong. I just threw up again out of disgust just thinking about it.

I've been in therapy for 15 years, Ive done years of DBT and CBT, I've been an outpatient and an inpatient. Sometimes it helps me end whatever addiction I've used as a coping mechanism, but I always feel the same. I refuse to have my photo taken. Getting dressed in the morning brings me to tears. I am afraid of showering because my body makes me feel physically sick. I avoid public places and now have been avoiding friends and family because I've put on weight and can't bear having them see me. Instagram and facebook makes me suicidal on a daily basis. I've had an eating disorder since I was 10. I drink every night because its the only way to escape how Im feeling. Whenever I am sober I dont sleep for days and days, staying up crying over how repulsive I feel. I make excuses to avoid my attractive friends because the jealousy sends me over the edge (I dont hold it against them but I envy that they get to feel good about themselves, or at least dont feel ill or suicidal over their looks). 

I just got let off work early because I threw up over my own reflection. My boss thinks I have a stomach bug. I just don't see a solution. Nobody should have to live like this - I'm consistently miserable nomatter which professional I see or what treatment or medication I take. I also cant socialize without alcohol otherwise my appearance makes me so nervous and uncomfortable I will throw up. Social situations usually end with me leaving within an hour of arriving smoke bombing bexause I am so self conscious and repulsed by how I look in comparison to everyone else.

If I manage to avoid mirrors for a while I can sometimes keep it under control momentarily but then I get my photo taken or see my reflection  and then I 'm back to being suicidal again and have panic attacks over it. It gets worse each time.

 Its just not fair I dont know why it upsets me so much. Other people who dont feel necessarily attractive dont feel this negatively about themselves, why do I?

Its ruined my life. I havent achieved anything because im a consistent nervous wreck of a person, or Im wasted to try and escape. I cant concentrate on anything. I just want the nightmare to end. Whenever i get my hopes up, i just fall into a worse state when i realize im just uglier with each coming day. I cant focus on long term goals because I struggle not to end it every day.

My question is has anyone recovered? Can I get any better? I just want it to stop. I dont want to have to die but I see no other way out after everything Ive tried. Ive tried makeovers, exercise, diets, hypnosis, medications, therapy, hospital - it just never gets better. Im struggling to come up with any reason not to give up."
Brasnol,5b3og0,1478267818,Just need some help!,"I need help. I was out with my friend and we met a girl. The girl was more interested in me but my friend wanted more. It ended up in a discussion. Hated that situation. Well I stayed with her and he left. I messed up with  her. It was 3 or 4am and I just wanted to leave. Not getting laid but just leave. I went with her home. Stayed for an hour and left because it felt not right. I have depression, an anxiety disorder which is killing me. While I am sitting here my whole body is filled with anxiety. I cried. I cried because I said to myself that I am worth it. For one moment, this thought was louder than my negative thoughts. Thoughts that I messed up in life. Thoughts that I am a failure. One moment of less pain. 



But 10 minutes later I was back in this dark place in myself. Everything hurts. Tension in my face. Pain. Something I can't live with any longer.

Jockelson,5d2rrf,1479220225,Tired of it all,"*sigh* Where to begin, where to begin...

When I was 20 and in university, I met an American woman online (I am European, btw). To be able to pay for the phone calls and plane tickets (this was well before Skype took off), I took jobs on the side, which ultimately made me drop out of university. Until 4-5 years later, when I visited her, she appeared to have another boyfriend. Altough my parents were happy that my American adventure had ended, I was heartbroken. This was the first time I really thought of ending everything.

But I didn't, instead I started working fulltime and tried to get my life back on track. Unfortunately, two short years later, my father died after a short illness. Even to this day, I have always felt terribly guilty towards him after his death, for hurting him so bad with that whole American affair while he had so short to live (even though nobody knew about that).

Luckily, a couple of months later, I met a woman. We fell in love, got married, got a home, and had a couple of lovely children. I had a pretty good job, despite the lack of a university degree, and I seemed to have gotten over my depressive thoughts.

Until a couple of years ago. It feels like after the children came, many things have changed. My wife stopped working to take care of the kids, but it felt more and more we were roommates instead of lovers. The house is a total mess, I have literally no room for myself any more, no room for any hobbies, everything is taken up by the children's toys and my wife's stuff. And I do mean old stuff. Baby clothes that don't fit the kids any more. A broken stereo. Stacks of magazines. Furniture. Did I mention she is a hoarder?

Then, I fell in love with a girl online again. I never felt more at ease talking with someone. Escapism, probably. Despite having learned my lesson years ago, my feelings for this person grew deeper and deeper, and we chatted for hours every day. One year, two, three... Five years. Until all of a sudden, a couple of weeks ago, she totally disappeared. From chatting for hours per day, to zero contact, overnight. Was I catfished? Did I say something wrong? Did something bad happen? I don't know. And altough sometimes I do miss her... I am not sure I care.

But my depressive, and suicidal, thoughts returned. Visited a psyciatrist, who prescribed me anti-depressants. Not sure they work. Not sure if anything works. Talking about my feelings seem to help for a short while.

All of this got me thinking of my marriage. With the online girlfriend out of the way, I feel I can think straight again. At least, if I would leave my wife, it would not be for another woman. The house is still a mess, she has an entire *floor* taken up with her stuff, up to the point where I am forced to move *my* stuff to self-storage, because ... well, there simply is no room for it any more. Literally. I showed pictures of it to the psych, who responded with ""holy crap, I knew it was bad, but not *this* bad""... 

It feels like there is no room for me any more in my own house. It's been ages since we had sex, it feels all love is gone... The only love I feel, is the love for my children. But I cry myself to sleep, realizing that those feelings I have for my children, are the only thing that make me go on, the only thing that keep me from taking a long walk off a short pier. With my wife, there is tension, there are arguments, fights, even in front of the children, about the most unimportant stuff... I keep feeling that she is part of the problem, because she literally gives me no room to do anything in my own house. But she doesn't see it that way, blames it all on the psych who appearantly is incompetent and can't help me.

After a few deep talks with a friend (who is going through a very rough divorce, but somehow manages to keep smiling), I felt I had built up enough courage to step up and tell her I want to leave. But just as I want to tell her this, she calls me to tell that she felt a lump, and made a doctor's appointment.

And bingo. She got the diagnose that no woman wants to hear. How unfair can it get. I see no value in life any more, keep thinking about ending my own life daily, have emotionally cheated on the mother of my children for years (and got what I deserved), have smoked secretly for years now... and *she* gets cancer. Seriously. If there is a God, and if somebody had to be punished, why couldn't He pick me?

Of course, now I need to be there for her. And I am. Failing marriage or not. But I don't know how to keep going on. I can't take much more of this life. I can't think of many reasons to keep going on. My wife will survive, her prognosis looks good. The kids will get there too, I am sure. My mom has moved on a long time ago already and found a new boyfriend (who seems to enjoy picking fights with me, so no sympathy there).

Why would I even bother getting up another day. I feel there is not much to live for any more. I'm done. Finished. Finito. Basta. All I wanted was just a place to come home to. A place to *feel* home.
"
xzy09,5fb740,1480332577,I am considering it more and more,"I feel I should give you a backstory:

I'm currently in one of the final years of med school in one of the east european countries. 
I started med school for many reasons: financial stability, wanting to help others etc. But the most important factor in my decision was the fact that I had a relationship and I wanted to be able to provide for my future gf/wife and to enable her to pursue her passion in arts without the financial constraint. 

Needless to say we broke up around the 4th year of studies and that has left me with no actual purpose in life.
On top of that in a short span of 2-3 years I had alot of relatives and family friends die or get seriously ill: my grandfather died, my other granfather was diagnosed with alzheimer's disease and cannot take care of himself now, one very close family friend died of cancer; and in the last few days another relative just died. 

Since the breakup and the first events I can't study anymore - I've got constant anxiety, panic attacks to top that ,occasional paranoia and my mood is not stable at all
I'm not motivated anymore to do anything - let alone study.
The only relief I've felt is in indulging in video games all day.

I've always felt empty inside but I hoped I will find something to fill that void - be it a person or an occupation.Thing is I found all of those but I lost them.  

I've been thinking to just quit school and pursue another career but I don't think I'll succeed in any field. 

I feel like a dissapointment - to myself and to others, a failure. 

Just these few days I've been crying day in and day out - I feel like I'm obligated to do something for which I am not prepared. 

Exams are coming up in a few days, exams for which I did not study again.

I've been contemplating suicide for quite some time now and the desire to end it all seems to grow stronger and stronger with each passing day 
I'm guessing tonight is as good as any "

Life feels so pointless at times.
I think everyone has felt that way at least once.
Most people deal with it and continue on, day to day.
But the truly hurt and damaged, decide to end it all.
However they choose to do it, their mind is made up.
They want to end it all, stop the hell they are in.
Many people would say this is weak, selfish even.
But some may argue that this act is brave,
For no one really knows what happens next…
If one is in constant misery daily for years, or decades,
Are they obligated to go on?
Suicide is so heavily looked down upon, it's even considered a crime.
But why? Nobody ever asked to be be born.
Life itself seems to be a miraculous cosmic anomaly.
So is consciousness a blessing or a curse?"

FruityTeaLeaf,5f8h85,1480291691,"Isolated, feel like a freak, dealing with overpowering urges","TL;DR: Lack of meaningful connections in life makes me feel empty, prone to sudden but strong feelings of suicide. 

The thoughts I've been having about suicide tend to grow in a snowball effect; I'll begin to contemplate the idea, and before I know it I'm dealing with very real and very scary urges to end it right there (I have no plan, but I worry as I've always had an impulsive side)
I don't want to die, it terrifies me. I want to be better more than anything, but as time goes along I see less and less of an alternative. In those moments when the urges are the strongest I'd do anything.

Recently I've been living abroad, where I spent 6 months almost in complete isolation. These months have taken a huge toll on me emotionally, and has basically worsened the general problems I've been dealing with all my life.

A bit of background information:
Went through periods of neglect and abuse as a kid, never gained any qualifications, dropped out of sixth form (British version of high school) 3 times. I was bullied mercilessly throughout my school years, and it seemed like every day I was reminded of the fact I was a freak and loner. I've yet to have one close friend. 

After I left,  I began to enter a cycle that I'm still repeating today, move somewhere new in search of a fresh start and the possibility of reaching out to new people who never knew me as the 'easy target' at school. 
However, I feel doomed to failure every time, as I'm a permanent outcast everywhere I go. 
I drop out, stop seeing people, start isolating myself and barely leave the house. Then I decide to escape by leaving for some other city/wherever. And so it continues. 

I really do like other people, I love spending time in company, and I really do want close connections with people but I just don't understand why I can't form these connections. I feel like I'm not fit for other people and I'm hindering them. I don't want to be the person everybody talks to out of pity, but I can't shake the feeling that this is who I am. I suppose I am a little naive and eccentric, but always the kid with their nose pressed up against the glass, watching other people's happiness from afar. 
I've had 3 relationships in my life, one ended up very toxic and all three relationships have ended before the 6 month mark.
I especially find myself intimidated yet wanting of friendship with women (purely platonic, I am a straight woman myself). I don't know, I just crack under the pressure of it, if that makes sense.

I've always been a huge fan of art and consider myself somewhat talented, and it has always been a huge boost of confidence, but lately I've barely even picked up a pencil. I'm worried I'm losing my touch, and I'm scared that I'm losing my one passion in life.

I'm kind of trailing off here, so I'll leave it at that, but I desperately needed to get my thoughts on paper (or typed out) for others to see. I just don't want to be the only person who knows anymore.

Man, I've heard all the advice on this site and none of it really works; it's more a matter of meeting the right person at the right time.  Improving your life is only a part of the solution; I see drug bangin' thugs with girls all the time.

I don't know what you guys believe, but I've been reading the truth contest and it speaks about ""balance"", no doubt ripped from another philosopy; but the idea of everything averaging out over many lifetimes speaks to me.  If you are very lonely and everything stacks against your favor no matter how hard you work, there will be a time when you will find companionship and everything will fall into place with ease.    It's just that at this time we're in the wrong side of the balance due to previous lives"

Fast forward to freshmen year and I just start high school with thoughts of it being a new start and all I'm still harassed and hated by many I barely have any friends that don't ditch me at social events and ignore me daily making me feel invisible if not there at all it's almost like all my reality is distorted I'm not at risk of killing myself but I just need some advice "
thisismysadaccount88,5d1fys,1479197308,Failed attempt #3... Sort of,"Been dealing with some stuff lately and everything just keeps piling on top of each other and for the first time in a couple of years since the last time, I had absolutely no will to live. 
Now, I'm not saying every day has been a ray of sunshine since that last time. No. I never got that ""I'm so happy to be alive I'm so glad I'm not a corpse"" feeling. But I've managed to get at least something out of life. Always something holding me over to the next breakdown.
Oh I'll wait until summer. Oh I'll wait until after my birthday. Oh I'll wait until school. 

I'm done waiting. 

Or at least I though I was.
So 1:50 am me is depressed as usual and panicky and can't sleep and has the weight of the world on them. You know the feeling. So I decide to walk half of the bridge nearest me, about a 20 minute walk to the middle. Boom, done, I'll be on the next flight to no where by 2:30. 
This bridge is a landmark where I live, a lot of people walk it to get to the other side of town and there's a lot of traffic. During the day that is. My whole trip out there I see maybe 5 people.
Half way through the wind starts picking up. I feel tears in my eyes as the cool air brushes against my face. I should have brought tissues. I'm not even crying, I just didn't think of how windy it would be. 
So I get to the middle. There it is. The opportunity of a lifetime. Literally. The weight of the world on my shoulders I could just climb over the bench and the guard rail and be done with it. 

But I pussy out. 

I don't know why. Everything still sucks no matter how juvenile that sounds. I don't know what made me change my mind but around 2:25 I turned around and started walking home.

I'll have to bring tissues next time. "
TodayIfuckedupthrow,5d1ouu,1479202470,Today I told a friend how I felt about her and she attempted suicide,"We were talking on the phone.
We were about being open and honest and feelings. After a while she started asking me how I felt about her, and I told her. Bear in mind I've known her for over 6 years and have been helping her deal with her breakup with her kid's dad over the last 4 months.
After I told her she got fairly quiet and said I'll call you back in ten minutes. She got back to me about an hour later and explained she had talked to her baby daddy and he had confirmed that their relationship was over. As I talk to her about if and let her vent she casually mentions she took 3 bottles of pills and drank half a 26. So I try and convince her to throw it all up, fail, so I call the ambulance and her ex(they still live in the same house). He gave me an update that she was on her way to the hospital, hopefully in time. Fuck."
stunnedandlost1,5fgg1f,1480391414,I need serious advice about checking myself in for suicidal impulses/what i do about my job,"It's too much to type to explain the details of what I am going through, but to put it shortly: I am having frequent thoughts of suicide and I am impulsive right now and I already have hit my head against the wall a couple times as self harm, and I know where I can find my granddad's gun and I am very very scared that I might use it. It might not be tonight. It might not be tomorrow. But with how I am feeling right now I am very worried that I might actually do this and I DO NOT WANT TO. But with these high emotions I am experiencing and these impulses, I'm afraid I won't actually be able to stop myself.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm thinking I might need to check myself in somewhere. But I don't even know. The ER? What will they do? How long would I be there? Wouldn't that just make me feel worse and more ashamed where I would actually do the deed when I get back?

&amp;nbsp;

But worst of all, I work at a drug store. I'm full time, but I've only been there less than 4 months. I don't even know if I could get time off, even without pay. Like I don't think I would have a job to come back to because we are so short staffed and I'm one of two shift supervisors. And this week my manager is on vacation so my workload is extra, and the NEXT week the other shift supervisor is on vacation, so more of the same. I might lose my job, right? And the whole point of going into a hospital is to preserve my life, right? So if I lose my job (trust me it will be near impossible to find another job in the area I live/ I had a hard enough time getting THIS one) what would be the point in living after that? That would make my life even more of a hell. So like...what do I do. What do I do? I'm scared I'm going to impulsively kill myself but I would DEFINITELY have to do it if I lost this job.

&amp;nbsp;

Please, any advice or guidance, anything would help. I'm very worried about myself. I don't want to hurt my mom and twin like this. I don't know what to do."
seawaterpizza,5d6zqc,1479266154,Pros and cons of killing myself.,"Pros. 
I won't have to suffer anymore, I am diagnosed with bipolar type 2, double depression and borderline personality disorder. All these make living life day-to-day a nightmare. 

I'll stop hurting others. And I don't think it's possible for me to be in a relationship which makes me feel really lonely. I feel like I'm terrible in relationships. My boyfriend said he doesn't love me anymore and I blame that on my instability. 

I'm a veteran and sometimes it feels like the VA Crisis Line doesn't care either. I've been put on hold by them before for up to 15 minutes. Also it takes me months to book an appointment at a VA facility so if I need help it's really hard to receive. Also the psychiatrist that I have been seeing doesn't really listen to me I'll tell him about some of the side effects that I'm having and he'll just add another medication to the mix to solve that problem instead of maybe changing out the medication that caused the problem in the first place. 

I feel like my boyfriend and I are about to break up soon and I only have one other friend in this fucking city. My boyfriend is my best friend so if I lose him I wouldn't know who to turn to since I feel like I annoy my other friend sometimes when I talk to her. She'll listen but then sometimes she'll push me away, she says that I suffocate her. 

I don't have a job, I'm getting by on disability money and I feel useless. When I have a job though it usually stresses me out so much like for example I have cut my wrist at works once just because one of my coworkers got mad at me. There's other times at other jobs I've had where I'll just have a break down on the job like once or twice a month. Other times where I've had to call in because my depression was just really bad or I was having a manic episode and my bosses and coworkers would get mad at me for missing a lot of shifts and they would have to cover my ass. 

And last but not least I just spend most days crying and wallowing in my sadness. If I'm not depressed then I'm either manic or so numb that nothing matters. 

Cons. 

My family which lives hundreds of miles away from me would probably be really hurt. I've known loved ones that have killed themselves and I don't want to cause them that pain. 

That's it... I don't really have any other reason to live. "

Sh3lf1sh,5e2f5c,1479705765,I wish I could die without if looking like suicide,"I want to die so badly right now. My suicidal thoughts are now louder than ever, and it's getting worse and worse. Some people have epilepsy, some have peanut allergies, but at least they would have ways to die that aren't clearly suicide. I've been doing things that I know are bad for me in hope that one day they just kill me (extreme caffeine consumption, not wearing a seatbelt, plugging stuff in when I can't see the outlets, ECT.). Small things in hope that one day something goes wrong and I die

Now what I'm about to say is really fucked up, but I'm venting. If you aren't okay with reading anything kind of fucked up, stop reading. I got that out of the way, so I'll start by saying that my mate got in a car accident a few days ago. He was driving way too fast on a bumpy road, and spun out of control into a tree. He's okay, injured, but okay. However, other people were in the car, and one of them died because she wasn't wearing a seatbelt. Like I said, as bad as it sounds, I envy her. I wish I could take her spot, because then someone of value would still be alive, and I wouldn't be. I've thought about it so much, just wanting to get in a fatal crash so I don't have to be the guy who killed himself "

IWillDieSooner,5fbizo,1480338024,"I am unloved, unaccepted, undesirable","I got nothing to lose posting here.

I joined 15 dating sites and frequent them frequently each and every day since February of this year.

I went on one date out of all of them and it didn't end in a way that made sense to me.


I must have tried speaking to hundreds of girls and almost never ever get a reply back probably because I am unattractive.
No matter how polite and funny I try be on these sites I am never worth a response, I am not obligated a response I keep telling myself, but the fact I don't even get a first look makes me feel less than human.

I am a virgin, only had my first date at 20 and that is it, I keep thinking of this, like as a creature put on this earth I will never experience a natural act that creatures do, that I will remain untouched, unloved, undesirable in every sense of the word.

Every day just feels the same coming home and doing the same routine all alone.

I want sex okay? I desperately want to experience the touch of a girl close to me, it validates me as a person.

I can't even do that because I am ugly, and pale, and skinny and stupid.
I don't know why I can't even get responses back, I am not nasty I just am bitter from being unloved.


Try convince me downing a couple bottles of wine and all the pills in my medicine cabinet for a sweet death is not better than crying every weekend till I fall asleep"
cynicalsadbastard,5f570b,1480251659,I'm done.,"I hate existence. There's a constant scenario playing in my head where I put a bullet through my head. Another is of myself getting in a ghastly accident, like final destination or something. I get ""fits"". I can't actually yell, because other people might find it odd. So, at least 10 times every day I have to rush about to find a solitary place, usually a bathroom, and do a silent scream. There's an almost contant yelling inside my head. It's mostly profanity. Directed against myself and my mother. 

I've dissociated from reality and society to such a point that I can't enjoy *anything* anymore. I'm constantly looking for an audience at this point. I feel like something went wrong in my brain due to prolonged isolation durig my formative years. People commented when I was 15, that I don't spend much time socializing. Now, I'm almost 22 with no change in my situation. At college, I am somewhat famous for being 'the quiet dude'. In my family, it's canon that to meet me you'll have to call me or barge into my room. I phase-out a lot. 

I don't feel like a person. I feel like the rest of humanity is something different from me. I can't talk to anyone about anything. I feel hatred towards other people just because they can be something that I'm not. I'm a 22 years old dude with the angst of a teenager. 

I used to be an avid reader, now I forget everything about a book as soon as I finish it. I can't finish watching movies because I get really bored and feel like I'm being suffocated by myself. Music is just noise, unles someone is screaming about murdering people, which I think is a proxy way for my brain to calm down. I wasn't allowed to have a life. I can't remember anyhthing anymore. I feel like there's someone else making my body do stuff, while by brain, or ""I"", is bouncing around thoughts in a closed container. And it's been getting more and more violent and apathetic. Like Sandy Hook violent. When I see other people, I don't want them to exist anymore. At first I grew indifferent to their existence. Then I got annoyed by it. Then I got angry. I see people, and all I want is for them to die along with their loved ones. I keep browsing /r/watchpeopledie, because it still makes me somewhat.....shocked, numbed or such. Maybe afraid or something. I can't really tell. I guess this quote from a book I read might have some insight. Because I'm not introspective enough to figure it. 

""‘The men would all say that they had died,’ Gilligan said. ‘These were the most incorrigibly violent characters. They would all say that they themselves had died before they started killing other people. What they meant was that their personalities had died. They felt dead inside. They had no capacity for feelings. No emotional feelings. Or even physical feelings. So some would cut themselves. Or they would mutilate themselves in the most horrible ways. Not because they felt guilty - this wasn’t a penance for their sins - but because they wanted to see if they had feelings. They found their inner numbness more tormenting than even the physical pain would be.’""


The best part is, I used to be somewaht normal. If you want a case against love, my situation is it. My mother's love and protection literally killed me. 


And to be honest, do whatever you may I won't be helped anymore. I've already tried suicide twice. One time I was so drunk, I passed out before I went through. And this time I won't be convinced. I've written a note. Once I send it to my brother and father, I'm gonna get drunk and cut my wrists.

And let's be honest. No one wants to help anyone like me. I can successfully predict everything people will say if they know what I'm *really* thinking. 

""This is depression. You must seek help"". 

I would have if I could. 

""I'm here if you need to talk.""

You'll fuck off after two mesages and all you will ever repeat is same old shit that's in the auto-biographies of the terminally ill.

What's the point of going on, if I've got nothing to look forward to? I'm not interested in anything anymore. There's no meaning to my life. I'm not a part of society.  I can't stand existence, if all it has in store for me is anger and pain. "
ScubaDuba672,5dmgnp,1479476710,Here commenting again because if I can share an experience that could help someone else it helps give my life meaning.,"Today I feel overwhelmed, I just can't seem to get ahead and I am under extreme pressure with high risk work projects I'm slow to do things and over the last few months I've had to wonder if my ADHD is defeating me and if need to disclose this to explain my inability concentrate, and try to get some flexible hours like working a few hours on the weekend when Noone else is there - I can't get in the zone because I'm constantly being distracted. I feel like my work is out control and I don't know how to catch up. Suicide is again becoming my back up plan if it all comes crashing down. 

It's been a crazy year, between work and study I've worked myself into the ground and just about broken my mind, sometimes it's hard to know if I'm losing touch with reality, jumbled thoughts and inability to to stay focused on conflicting tasks, and while I know I have good skills and capabilities, not being able to deliver fast enough is causing me to feel like a failure again. My life revolves around my work and I'm trying to change that but I can't figure out if I'm broken already. It would be so much easier to just slip away and hopefully find peace in death that I've can't find right now in life. "
[deleted],5cejom,1478871996,"I'm Weak, sensitive and worthless. I just want my pain to end.","I really hate myself. Haven't ate today but I'm still frustrated at myself for eating last night... Good god I hate myself. No matter what I want to kill myself. I'm tired of feeling life, all I feel is pain. I don't want to feel any longer, I don't want a messed up future I want to end it now and end it with dignity but I don't know how. The only thing keeping me here isn't the fact I have a boyfriend that loves me and him and his family care a lot for me , I've become too selfish to the point the only reason I'm not killing myself is because I don't know a way to do it with 100% chance of death. 

I can't bear being in this world any longer... I couldn't care how sick I got because the pain of a psychical sickness is trivial compared to what I feel in my mind and I hate it. I always get told it'll get better and I have things to appreciate but I'm just too unappreciative and this doesn't take the pain away. 

I've been depressed for as much as my life as I can remember , had problem with ed since 11 and my anxiety has got increasingly worse over the past year even though it's been there for a few years now... I just feel like nothing can get better. I'm trapped where I am now. I'm trapped and I keep beating myself up because my parents make me feel so crap when they tell me about how I ruin their life and how being gay isn't a choice and I'm choosing to betray and hurt the family. I can't see myself the same way as my mother keeps telling me I'm this vile disgusting person and all my problems will continue to follow me as I always seek out sympathy and I enjoy it and I cause all my problems. 

I've always disliked myself but recently it's just getting too much ... The last year has been the worst year of my life. Yet things are better, I have a boyfriend and the bullying at my school is much less severe yet I feel worse ... Before my boyfriend , I didn't know what it is like for someone to love you, someone to hug you and someone to always care about you no matter what and not use your feelings against you. It's terrifying , I wish I could replace myself with a happier person. A person he deserves , so I could just remove myself from this life once and for all. 

 I'm just such a weak and sensitive worthless person... I constantly panic and hate myself. I've tried so hard to get better with exercise, Meditation , watching my died, Going outside , talking to people and had it thrown back in my face repeatedly by my psychologist and parents telling me I don't care and I don't try and I don't want to get better  ... I'm not sure I really want to go but I can't get out of feeling like this and the feeling only becomes more intense , I feel like it's more a question of when my suicide is rather than if it ever happens ... "
laneylullaby,5b74vr,1478303927,Please please please help!!,"ive gone through a lot. I don't know how to cope. I had two therapists, but my parents fired the one who helped and left me with the one who only does biofeedback, not talk therapy. When I was 7 i had severe body issues (which led to an eating disorder at age 12), anxiety, and depression of some form. I used to fake sick so I could lay in bed and cry. This impacted my social life. My best friend made new friends, and since I had anxiety, i panicked, thinking that she was going to leave me alone. This caused me to start fights when I tried to express my feelings. Because of so many failed friendships, I had no idea what a normal relationship was like. This led me to seek out the wrong people. I ended up getting emotionally and sexually abused by my second boyfriend when i was 13. During the times when he was sexually abusing me, I sort of blacked out, i think its called dissociation. Since I can't remember most of what went on, I don't know how far he took things. For all I know, I could have lost my virginity to him. Later that year, I ended up in the psych ward at Boston Childrens (Bader 5.) I had a horrible experience. The summer before my freshman year in high school (age 14) I got into a friends with benefits relationship with this boy I knew. That summer was when I first remember having sex. It was unceremonious and completely degrading. It was on the floor, in the dark, in his basement. To make matters worse, this was the first time we had seen each other out side of school, and he made me roleplay as his little sister. Now, what I needed was to feel special, and I looked in completely the wrong place. It made me feel worthless. He did nothing wrong though, and this certainly isn't new or shocking. Women do things like this all the time, I'm not trying to say that making a mistake with him was in any way abusive. However, for someone like me, it was a mistake that drove me farther into the darkness. I had no idea what being loved or in love felt like, I didn't even know what it felt like to be treated as an equal. After him, came my current boyfriend. I'm still 14, but I turn 15 in december, if that helps put things in perspective at all. My current boyfriend cheated on me, and now I'm in a poly relationship with him and her, because I'm too afraid of being alone. He's also the best relationship ive ever been in. That being said, hes 16, homeless, and he claims he's off heroin now, but prior to me finding out and begging him to stop, he was very much addicted. I'm not asking for a scolding, or a fingerwagging or any of that nonsense. Don't tell me to break up with him, im not in a mental state in which that is an option for me. Please just tell me what I can do to cope without therapy!! Thank you so much!

Update:
My bio feedback therapist has begun doing some actual therapy with me, and things are beginning to look up. At the moment, I'm losing myself in watercolor paintings. My grades are shit and I'm under constant and aggressive pressure from my parents to ""get better"" and ""make better choices,"" but I think that's normal for my age. I broke up with the heroin addict. I've been in a few fwb relationships since, and I'm beginning to feel emotionally healthy enough for fwb relationships to be safe for me. Long story short, either things are getting better, or I'm getting better at not caring. Thank you very much, to those of you who offered me help. "
Deansaster,5dh4j0,1479404457,Attention Envy,"First of all, I kind of hate how often I have to post here, and I hate how whiny i feel for it, but then again, I kind of hate everything right now, especially me.

Then to the main post: Somehow, when I see posts of someone posting for their friend, some stranger even, who displays signs of suicidal thoughts or depression and asks for help for them, I get so far down. I wish my friends would notice something, but all the most obvious things even seem to get ignored. I wish someone cared that much about me, bothered to send me a few positive things from someone to brighten my day. It makes no sense, because when I am down, it wouldn't help and I **know** that my friends are busy themselves, they have their own issues and downs, but god, I just wish someone cared enough to, well, care even when I'm not already holding a goddamn knife to my wrist. t the same time, I wish the last time I did I hadn't been saved, because then I wouldn't have to sit here and realise how fucking lonely and unwanted I am. People wouldn't have to listen to me whine all over the place over random shit. I wouldn't let anyone down anymore, wouldn't annoy them or make them feel bad over nothing. I can't see any downsides to it. I just can't, and yet some selfish part of me believes I somehow earned that someone sees this and gives a shit and idk if I want to prove to myself that someone does or that no one does so I can finally accept that for good.

But I've always been the one left out. Last one picked on a team, ignored during recess, excluded when I asked to join any game or party or gathering or even clubs. No one bothered picking me up or taking me along at any point, no one bothered checking in on me, no one bothered making sure I wasn't dying when I'd be lying on the street. My own goddamn mother didn't give a fuck that I was almost dying, so why should anyone? Why should I? Why not just end this for good and stop this mess when only maybe one person ever cared?
believe me, I want to hold on to not let her down on top of it all, I already have way too many times, but how when everything is pain? How are you strong for someone when you feel like you are burning alive?"

My main source of income were scholarships, which was enough to pay for my tuition and my room and board but those are all nullified from failing a course. I mostly feel awful because I have cost my family so much money though they believed in me, upwards to hundreds of thousands of dollars and I'm costing more by the day. I'm arguing with my year and a half girlfriend, whom I have a long distance with now and I see every so often on weekends, so much we've broken up a few times. All of this stress has made it impossible for me to sleep and I've gone over 48 hours without sleep. I've missed classes from passing out and it leads to a circle. I have been playing so many video games to keep my mind sane but it's gotten ridiculous. I have over 100 hours on a game that came out last week. I'm starting to feel like I'm just destined to fail and the world would be better without me. Please don't give the the dime a dozen ""Your family will miss you"" or ""The world needs you"".

I don't want to go into any details, this happened only a few days ago and I haven't been able to talk about it to anyone. I feel what I can only describe as survivor guilt. And I feel wobbly in my own resolve to win a battle that we were fighting (I thought) together. How do I even think about moving on, staying strong, when she made a very different choice? How do I deal with the guilt?"

i seriously hope something bad will finally happen, so i can bring myself to do it

right now im only thinking about it, but i do hope that maybe i get hit by a car or someone kills me

i probably couldnt do it, because i know my family couldnt live without me, but i dont enjoy life
everything is a burden

Victoren,5bdbgq,1478394455,I don't want to grow up. Thinking about ending it.,"I'm 18 at the moment. I have a very good family and I'm pretty well off in terms of money. However, I simply don't want to grow up. I want to go back to my childhood when I was a happy kid.

I don't have friends, lost all of them because I simply was locked in my room for the last six months. I can't go in public anymore since I get anxious by watching people there are about my age passing through. I can't concentrate to study. I can't go to classes because AI get anxious and start hurting myself. To sum up, I can't do anything besides being a complete failure.

I just wanted to disappear. I just can't explain. I feel like there is a void inside of me. I don't have ambitions, goals, concentration, motivation, desires. The only thing I care about, at the moment, is my family, but, unfortunately, I also don't want to see them because I feel that I don't deserve them.

I'm thinking about suicide. I have considered it before, but was too scared to try something. Now, the situation has got worse. I don't know what to do. I'm scared. I constantly get anger attacks and start throwing everything on the wall. I'm crying typing this. I don't know what to do."

I had plans for a better life but my brain doesn't work anymore and now it's one mistake after the next, further destroying myself.  I have pulled out most of my hair.  I ruined my career, have no friends or family and just scared the only guy that was ever interested in me because he saw how crazy I got.  He's gone to his ex.  I lost my job in May because I couldn't be on time because I'm a moron.  I finally got another good job opportunity last month but I blew it because I overreacted over a test result and thought I was getting an autoimmune disease. Told the company I was getting sick and couldn't take the job.  In my field, that job would have saved me.  Only a crazy person would do that.  So I'm ruining my life because I'm crazy.  I've spent the last month listening to people who tell me they won't hire me because I've never been at a job for more than 2 years.  And I had an opportunity but ruined it.

My other friend has been my friend for 4-5 months. We've had our issues. But I truly do trust her. She has issues of her own and I understand them because she's my ohana. She pushes me away but doesn't really want me to go away. I know that that's considered a ""red flag"" or whatever but I know her reasons.

So long story short, she claims that she wants to stop being friends with me. And I just feel so fucking worthless since she can't confide in me and tell me the actual reason on why she wants to ""stop being friends"". But I trust her that she still wants to be friends. She's just trying to stop herself but I don't know why.

throwaway191191199,5b3b5c,1478263221,I'm so tired of trying,"I've lived with depression my entire life.  I do the right things; I exercise regularly, go to work, have an important volunteer job that keeps me engaged in my community, maintain friendships and family relationships, take my meds religiously, and see my shrink regularly.

I work so hard to keep my mental health marginally ok, and it's still a game of chance as to how long I can keep from crashing.  I'm crashing now, and I just don't have the energy to go through it again.

I am not good at my job.  I am terrified my manager is going to find out I am not good at my job, and I will get fired.  The anxiety is so bad that I have constant, low grade nausea that has been going on for weeks.  It's gotten bad enough that I can't tell the difference between nausea and hunger.  I've been dropping over a pound a week for the last two months, and I'm not trying to lose weight.

There's this guy.  I love him.  He says we can have sex but not a relationship.  I know, love sounds stupid, but in my 42 years of life, I've been in love twice before.  I know it when I see it.  I should cut him out cold turkey, but I can't deal with that and my job at the same time.

The problem is that these things have caused a downward spiral and even if both were to resolve in the best possible way, I'm already spiraling out of control and I just don't have the will to go through another depressive episode.  

People always tell me if I can just get through it, things will get better, and they're right.  What they don't say is once it's better, there's no guarantee how long it will stay better, it WILL come back.  

I've talked to my shrink about it.  He knows I am crashing.  I've talked to family members and a few friends.  They can't help.  I even called the suicide hotline.  That was the worst thing yet.  The lady there told me to just fake it at my job and hope nobody notices I can't do the work.  

If I knew that I could get better and really be better, I'd push through it.  The thought of toughing it out just to make it to ""sort of ok for a while"" just isn't enough.  I don't know what some internet strangers can say to help, but I feel as if I am out of options."
Purplish_Green,5br1re,1478577151,Another random mumbling while I wait,You don't have to read this all of you don't want to. I think ill use the stuff in Tylenol. It's cheap and it shuts down your liver. Maybe I'll take stuff sleeping pills so I go in my sleep. I think ill crush up the pills and mix them in water so it's easier to swallow. I don't want to throw up everywhere. Itll just leave a mess for my mom to clean up. I'll flavor it somrhow. Maybe I'll use these nifty tea things you put in a eater bottle and shake it up and drink it. Not a tea bag. It's synthetic or something. I like tea. I like to make sun brewed tea. Maybe I'll mix it with orange juice. I like orange juice too. I had a nice glass tonight. I drank it out of a mason jar so it was a nice big glass. I'll crush the pills with a mortar and pestle. There's one in the top shelf of the medicine cabinet. It's blue and made of marble. None of that matters though. I wonder if I should skip school when I do it. I'd like to see my friends again. I don't deserve them. Maybe I'll see doctor strange. It's good I think. I should have money left over from my pay after I get the Tylenol. Let me do some math real quick. Yeah I should. I got a raise recently. The company I work for was going to go on strike but they agreed to stop. I guess it worked out for me somehow. But it was only a  five cent raise for me. Maybe I'll go out to lunch. I like applebees. They have this nice dish that'd basically macaroni and cheese with barbecue sauce with chicken strips. It sounds pretty American. I don't know if I'll have enough for that though. I wonder if my girlfriend would like to skip school with me. It was pretty mean for me to say she didn't care last time. She does. I'd love to cuddle with her in the theater. They built a new theater in the next town over. It's neat I guess maybe. It doesn't matter. I try to talk to her about it but she doesn't think about it like I do. This is really long. I should go to the top and put you don't have to read this all of you don't want to. This is better then crying myself to sleep. I should get some sleep. I have 3 hours of band classes tomorrow. I play the saxophone. The big one. I forget what it's called right now. It doesn't matter. I'm sure they'll find a better replacement when I'm gone. My jazz band director handed out birdland the other day. I have a measure long solo and I can't get it right at all. I should apologize for that. Idk if I can type anything up tomorrow. I'll be so busy. I'm sorry to bother every one. This has nothing to do with my death. I shouldn't post this. The mods might remove it or something. It doesn't matter. Nothing really matters anymore. Sorry. Good night.

I'm constantly told by my family that I'm a selfish person, and I agree with them 100%. The issue is, when I give gifts to certain people, *those* people never express much gratitude, and when I host dinner parties, things go wrong, I cook the wrong thing, someone has a bad time, always. I routinely fuck things up in social settings and feel like I'm being inauthentic to myself, so I'm inclined not to try.

BetUrProcrastinating,5clgor,1478972577,I don't know what to do,"just brief background. I'm 18 and a freshman in college. I've been dealing with social anxiety and depression for a while now. It was really bad in high school, but ever since starting college, it's gotten a lot better, and I feel like I've been making friends and I've gotten to know a lot of great people.

But even though things had been going well, I feel like they're getting worse again. The first month of school I was doing so much shit, going to parties, going to club meetings, meeting new people, etc. But that has kind of stopped recently. Which by itself is fine, since like I said, I might not be doing a ton of shit and meeting a lot of new people, but I've consolidated a nice, tight group of friends.

But even though things have been going well, there is still something I lack in life, a romantic relationship with someone. In high school I had no success whatsoever, for a variety of reasons, to the point that I was kind of resigned to the fact that I would probably live and die without being in a relationship with anyone. And as pathetic as it seems, I was really OK with that, especially since I had gotten so used to it. Over the summer before college, I was way more concerned with trying to make friends. And that's part of the reason that I was so happy the first month of school. Because that's what I got. I was meeting new people, becoming friends with people... for the first time in my life I felt like people didn't view me as someone awkward, as someone lesser. People actually wanted to be friends with me, probably in large part due to the fact that everyone was a freshman and desperate to meet new people.

But then for maybe the first time in my life, I started having feelings for other people. I guess part of the reason I never really had a crush on anyone in highschool was that I was never really good friends with many people, and for me, anyway, I feel like I need to know someone well before I start to feel anything for them. So anyway, there was this guy I met who I knew was bi, and I asked him if he wanted to do anything sometime, but he told me that he was still uncomfortable with his sexuality, so he didn't want to do anything. Alright. no problem with that. I was a little dissapointed I guess, but I got over it.

But then I met this girl in one of my classes. It was during one of the first days, so no one really knew anyone else, so I just sat next to her and started talking. I had literally no interest in her at that point, I was just trying to make friends. And it went pretty well, and we started talking more and more, and we did some stuff after class a few times (like study for tests, get lunch, that kind of stuff) and I started to really like her. So I asked her if she wanted to hang out a few times, but she was unable to because she was busy over the weekends, which kind of bummed me out, but then a few days ago after class we got lunch together, and she was talking about how much she liked art, and I invited her back to my dorm to show her some of my drawings.

And from there... I don't really want to get into specifics, but I kind of fucked up. And I feel like if I was more confident or had more experience at this kind of thing I could have had a chance with her. But I was just so awkward and inexperienced I didn't know really what to do. I think we're still amicable, but I definitely don't have any shot of getting with her in the future, I guess.

And this has really been fucking with me for the past few days. But it's not really about losing a chance with her. Because I like her and all, but that's at least something I can get over pretty quickly. It's the fact that I feel like I'll never find anyone. I feel like I'll always be too awkward and depressed to actually have any kind of relationship. I don't give a shit about sex or physical intimacy. I just want to feel like someone cares about me. Especially after being spat on and tossed aside all my life, I just want to feel NORMAL. And I feel like that will never happen. I feel like I'm missing out on such a huge part of life. People talk about relationships all the time and shit, and it makes me feel so excluded to know that I'll probably never have one. But more than that, I feel like I'll always have some lingering shred of anxiety and depression, and that I'll always be different from other people. 

I honestly don't know what to do. I don't want to feel this way. I just want to be normal. But I don't know how to improve myself. I desperately don't want to kill myself. But I can't keep going on like this. I can't keep going on being inherently inferior to everyone else. I feel like if things don't get better in the next few years I'll end up killing myself. But I really don't want to. I just don't know what to do... I just want someone who isn't my family to care about me deeply. But I feel like that'll never happen."

Kanmot,5fjplf,1480438351,"I helped myself, I'm very proud and happy","I hand a recent bout and... I actually pulled myself out of it.

I haven't sought any professional help because I don't want to worry anyone in my close network (they are dealing with a lot of shit already) but, I recently had a breakdown and, unlike how it usually goes, I managed to convince myself that, given my blessed circumstances, there are ways (be it un-absolutely completely ideal) that I can live a fulfilling life.

I know I'm probably dealing with a lot ""less"" that a lot of people here are but I genuinely think there are many people with relatively ""favorable"" circumstances that still turn to suicide, I just want to say, ""fight on"" (that's all I cant think of right now, I'm sorry).

Regardless, this video really helped me recently: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcSUs9iZv-g

But they would all be so dissapointed, and whenever I dissapoint people, I start feeling dissapointed in myself.

I’ve lost all motivation to do much of anything at all, I’ve started hating myself more and more as time has gone on, and I don’t see a good outlook for myself regardless of what happens now. I’ve already gone through female puberty and there’s nothing I can do now about my body not being the way that I would like it to be. I could work out or whatever and go on testosterone, but I wouldn’t actually get the results I would like. And my hips are still growing, meaning I'm fucked. I will never be over 5’5, I will never have smaller hips than I do, my hands and feet will always be too small to be considered male, and I could keep going, but you probably don't care too much about the specifics. I don’t want to be a tranny, I don’t want to be a girl, I don’t have another option. So I feel ending it all would be best. I will never have what I want in life and I don’t want to lead the life I’m bound to. I know that I can never be a real man, and for me, being dead is better than always being a woman. "

I feel really lonely and sad. I dont even know how to tell anybody this. Last time i asked for help the person didnt care. My friends keep planning things without me and when ever i ask to join them i never get a response other than ""sorry"" or ""i thought you were busy"". My best friend used to meet me for lunch everyday at the same place but now she rather hang out with ny other somewhat friends. She does occasionally eat lunch with me though. But when she does she just stares off and doesn't talk or she brings my othee friend and talk to him and act like i dont exist. But every wensday i go to her house after school and she might talk to me for a few minutes then goes to do homework. I guess what im really asking is how to get over needing to be reassured constantly that she cares about me. I mean like every so often she will do stuff with me and ill feel like i do matter. But recently its really gotten to me where ive been hurting myself. Hell in was in the hospital a few weeks ago because i stabbed myself. Also doesnt help that my family recently divorced and my mom abandoned me and my dads girlfriend is a total Asshole. Its gotten so bad that i go home early from all venturing events because i feel so lonely and sad. Sorry about the drama. "
TheDestoyer,5fg1hh,1480386398,I'm looking for an excuse to die.,"I hate myself and want to die but I can't kill myself because I don't want to hurt anyone. So I think of ways that I could die so tha it wouldn't look like suicide. I realise I have a self destructive personality. I either intentionally or unintentionally sabotage myself so that I can't succeed. And it's really impacting my life hard. In high school I could deal with it and still pass but now in college it doesn't work too well. I've gotten to the point of considering dropping out just because I can't deal with it.

But I've always wanted to die, I have problems dealing with stress and it doesn't help that I put more pressure on my self making myself even more stressed. This usually passes after a couple of days but it's kinda getting worse everytime it comes up and I have no real way to deal with it. I've had suicidal thoughts since I was 10 so I've dealt with this for 9 years now. And it's never gone away, at some point when I was 16 I realized it would never go away so I just dealt with it and pretty much just repressed it or ignored it. And it works for a bit but i know it's not good. Depression seems t run in my family and my mother has it and me and my sister show signs of it. But I've never had the courage to kill myself. More so I never had the courage to hurt those around me that love me. Like I realize it's terrible to do it and that I shouldn't but I can't help but want to do it which makes me hate myself even more because I can't get over it even tho I know it's wrong. 

Tldr; I hate myself I want to die, but can't because I don't want to hurt the ones I love."

I'm not sure if I need to go to the ER or local Crisis Center or not. I am being treated for bipolar disorder, but I don't think I have been officially diagnosed. The psychiatrist hasn't said ""Yup, bipolar"" but It is pretty obvious. 

For the past two months I have told my psychiatrist I have been really depressed lately. He hasn't raised my medicine or done anything to help me. I'm not motivated, I'm failing school, I have a trial coming up, and he just says ""That's no good. See you in a month."" 

I've seen a therapist. They are difficult for me because they try to teach me how to rethink my life. Well, I naturally do that on my own before I sink into another depressive episode, damn it. I feel I'm talking to a wall. 

Recently, I've been wanting to die. I've been researching methods. I've thought about how a lot of these methods are not possible and how I don't want my fiancé to come home to me not alive anymore. I'm not saying I want to kill myself because I'm terrified of death and I don't want to leave her. I love her and I don't want to spend a day away from her. 

However, i told her about this and she has urged me to go to seek emergency treatment. I don't want to because I don't have a plan, so I think going to the ER or Crisis Center will be a waste of my time. Is suicidal ideation something I need to go to the ER for? Is wanting to die that badly something the ER or Crisis Center can help me with? "
Shayvrie,5f2b72,1480203196,The things are just getting worse.,"I think this is my first time posting here... Whatever, sorry if my English isn't perfect, I'm not an English native speaker and I'm not in the best condition to think of it.

First of all, it's not like I'm depressed (because I'm not. My mother suffers mental illness and my parents hates each others (it's a very strange relationship) I'm not affected at all because of that. I just want to run away from my house, because staying here it's like staying in hell. 

Secondly, I have two best friends who has their own problems. One of them, lost her father this summer and he's in something like a depression but not that bad (he doesn't want to admit it tho) in the last months he told me that he wanted to self harm and I was always encouraging him to not do it, because I self harm but he doesn't know,  and I don't think it's a good idea to tell that to my friends. Knowing that, I also started to smoke some time ago and they hate that really hard (they don't know that I smoke) and today one of my best friends told me that he would kill me if I smoke (obviously not serious)

And, even knowing that, I was thinking always, almost everyday on killing myself, I planned to commit suicide next year. But this isn't new,  from long time ago my head was full of suicidal thoughts, and no one in my personal life knows it. And my two best friends have their own problems, and sometimes suicidal thoughts and they tell that to me. I don't know how to feel because I don't want them to worry about me, and at the same time I'm feeling like such a hypocrite because I always tell them to not do things like self harm or try to kill themselves... Why the life has to be so hard? 

I always try to look happy in front of my friends even if I'm not (almost all the time) because if I'm weak I'll can't protect them before I leave this world. 
Thanks for taking your time on reading this bunch of nonsense, hope you have a beautiful day.

audgepodge626,5fl76y,1480452896,Freshman in College w/ No Future,"Something's wrong with me... I get depression so fucking intensely that I can't even wake up in the morning. Call me lazy, or whatever you want, but I get anxiety so bad sometimes that even walking into a room and sitting with a bunch of people freaks me the fuck out. I can't do it. I clam up, and my brain shuts down and I sweat so bad and I feel like nothing is real so I can't even function. 
That then leads to me not going to class. I do my work, but I'm really not intelligent at all so the work I turn in is shoddy and just overall terrible. Wanna hear something that will make me seem like the biggest piece of shit ever? My GPA is a 0.009. It's my freshman year of college, in the first semester and I'm already just fucking failing.
Yeah. 
I can't go to class because of my anxiety and AWFUL depersonalization disorder, and on top of that my anxiety makes me unable to really speak to people so I don't have a lot of friends either and when I do I lose them. All the time. Because on top of all of that, I'm just a big fucking weirdo.
I don't know what to fucking do. 
I don't know what my future holds. I suck at making connections with people and I'm just so fucking dumb and useless so I know I'm going to fail at everything already!

For everything I do, it goes like this: I start out with them and everything is good at first. (jobs, school) and then my anxiety hits and I just... stop going. I never went to ROTC so I got kicked out of that. I never went to my summer job because I got such anxiety about going. I'll just wake up without a feeling of purpose at all so I just say ""fuck it"" and fail. And now it's happening with college. 

I fantasize about getting my hands on some sleeping pills, but I don't know how.
I HAVE to end my life. I'm such a fucking loser. And no one will miss me."
WampuClawGirl,5frbd9,1480531377,"My life is going no where, and I'm starting to realize that the only option for me is to die.","I am 21 years old and had a job from March 2015 to May of this year. I had to quit because my depression was so bad, and I came to the understanding about myself that having to be around people every day makes me extremely depressed and suicidal. So I've just been home these past six months doing nothing. I desperately want to enroll in online school, but how am I going to pay for it if I don't have a job? I *want* a job, I *want* to be able to earn money, but I have such an issue with being in the ""real world."" It's not exactly a matter of social anxiety or anything, I just feel so disconnected to the world outside of my bedroom and fantasy worlds. Having to go out there, interact with other humans, gets me so down I can't even describe it to you. I would gladly take an online job, or something I could do from home, but I'm not having any luck finding one. 

No job = no $ for college = no job experience = no job.

What the fuck am I going to do? I know I'm a worthless disappointment to my parents. I hate myself more and more every day. I wish there was something I could do about my situation, but as it is, I'm feeling like I'm never going to make it in this world – I feel like I don't belong here. I can't connect with other people whatsoever, and I have no desire to make friends. 

If you disagree with the notion that I shouldn't just end my fucking life right here and now, please make your case. Because *I* sure as hell don't see how I'm going to continue staying afloat. A life of going outside the house to work around people for 40+ hours a week, almost every day...I would seriously rather die than live in that kind of reality. I'm just not one of those people who gets emotionally charged from being around others, in fact it has the complete opposite effect on me...to the point, as I mentioned before, where I want to commit suicide.

Lisemarie87,5b7npl,1478310717,I just want to be done.,"My husband told me that he wasn't sure he wanted to be with me anymore in March. Then recently he told that he was sure he didn't want to be with me. But we still have to live together until June because we both can't afford to break our lease and neither of us have a place to go. 

So I'm just miserable all the time. He still pretty decent to me. But I'm in pain all the time. And I'm so devastated that eventually we'll be apart for real. 

We've been together five years and I really thought it'd be forever. I don't want to do this again. I don't want to try and find someone and have this happen again and again. I have zero desire to be in a world where it's just a cycle of pain. 

Nobody in my life knows. All our mutual friends think we're this great couple because it's too weird to explain we're not. So we just hang out with people and I put on a smiling face like everything is fine. Most of them have known him longer and one of my best friends is his cousin's wife. I'm going to be so alone when they find out. 

I had planned on waiting until we were really apart so he wouldn't have to deal with my death in such a direct way. But I don't know that I can make it that long. 

My birthday is in December and I don't if I can make it through it. I always get really sad on my birthday anyways. And now I'm going to be 29 with a failed marriage. Even though we had kind of split up I still threw him a big birthday party. And I know he's not going to do the same, and I'm too depressed to plan my own party. 

Yesterday I found our he was going to a play with mutual friends. I'm sure the friend didn't invite me directly because they assumed my husband would. So I got dressed and did my makeup tonight and was sitting on the couch hoping he'd invite me when he got up from his nap. But he just got up and left. He's never even gone to a play with me. And now I'm just alone and crying."

I have always been depressed, lonely - no friends, and increasingly suicidal. e.g. first thought in morning is often ""get out of bed, leave the house and kill yourself. Some days I write 'kill yourself' on my to do list in hopes that I will actually do it. It has taken me a year to even begin to apply to jobs because I thought it would make my depression worse. Because I have also been unemployed for 6 years, I have no references. My father has just been made redundant and I need to get a job to help pay the bills. I feel so worthless.

NotMyRealAccount8374,5c5gwf,1478745535,"So, I have a question...","I think about killing myself every single day. but I don't have the urge to kill myself. Like, its more of visualizing it. Like I'll space out/daydream and see myself putting a gun to my forehead and pulling the trigger, or walking off a bridge and being in free fall. they are invasive, but they don't necessarily bother me. **I just wasn't sure if this is something i should be worried about**. And it's not just once a day, they're pretty frequent. 

I have been pretty depressed in the past, and I did consider killing myself as well as having to resist the urge to. I saw a therapist in the past, but not really during that part of my life. (I drive over a bridge on the way back from college and almost a year ago I was very tempted to stop the car mid way and walk off. The therapist was months before then). The main things that kept me from actually doing it was knowing the impact it would have on my family.

 My mother and father are also my friends, not to mention that my dad looks up to me. he sees me as the person he could have been. I have a brother, which needs me to be there for him for several different reasons. and my dog. I am her life. she doesn't do so well when I'm away for too long. My family loves her, but I would feel awful putting all the responsibility to take care of her on them.

I've never really had anything traumatic happen to me aside from a pretty big break up a couple summers ago (which i still haven't completely recovered from. that being said, I have come a very long way). Overall I have a pretty good life, friends and family that loves me, working on completing my education. 23 year old guy. 

also should note that I've had these thoughts for years now, but they didn't become as prevalent as they are now till after the breakup.

but anyways, tl;dr. I daydream about killing myself daily, but i have no urge to at the moment. is that bad/weird/dangerous?"

Chance555,5dy81o,1479652022,I just want out and to get it over with,"So a few years ago, the love of my life commuted suicide. Gun to head with suicide note and all. I could have spent the rest of my life with this girl. She had an extremely rough life and was the sweetest and most beautiful person inside and out. But the pain was just too much. Today I understand more of why she did it because I'm feeling the same way. The only thing holding me back is I don't want anyone who knows me to go through any emotional pain, which is impossible when it comes to losing someone you care for. But life is just too much. No one is genuine anymore, people lie and stab each other in the back. We rape the world around us by killing the land we live on. The world is just a horrible place and I don't want to be a part of it anymore. I want out. Now. I want to be with my love again. I miss her so damn much. She understood me, she was there for me. She was everything. Nothing matters to me except her. I have no motivation for anything. I wake up hating my life and fall asleep hating my life. Yeah it's all mind set blah blah, I've heard it before but it just doesn't work. The bad just out weighs the good heavily and I'm done with it all. We are so selfish. All we do is consume and consume without thinking of the consequences. I guess what I'm trying to get at is this is a way of me finally putting my thoughts into words for once. It's not a ""if I commit suicide"" its ""when I commit suicide""

DrunknConfuzled,5b8uqh,1478330418,My Story,"Welp I guess I'll tell my story as an anonymous person because I can't even tell my parents or therapist the exact truth of the unending storm of thoughts within my head.

I'm 25, living at home and hate every minute of it. I guess I have friends but they don't do much for me. It all started when I was 18, my gf at the time who was a friend since I was around 14 and integrated within my friend group broke up with me. Before that we had sexual encounters, which weeks/months later would hit on my best friend in front of me which drove me CRAZY. I didn't show this crazy ever, I held it in. Apparently nothing happened between them. Anyway, we started dating, she broke up with me after I got mad about not wanting a 3-sum with my friend... I instantly drove off after receiving that text and flipped my truck off the highway going 80.
Afterward, I dropped all my friends, all my contacts. I tole my best friend what I did and that I was planning on staying away for a while. It was months, but I finally recovered and got back into the world.

Fast forward to me being 25, I started ""seeing"" my best friends sister who turned 18 and it was great. I loved the girl, I knew her most my life. We were just hooking up most every night until she suddenly stopped messaging me back, I got depressed and found out she started seeing someone else. I couldn't believe she did that to me with no response or anything. Did I forget to mention my friend and his sister lived together? I went over there one day, she was there and told me ""we weren't dating, I didn't wanna talk"".

Going forward 8 months after the shittiest months of my life having to balance seeing my friend and not seeing her at the same time, and we became ""friends"" again. Mostly I just pretended to not care and handle the pain.
She started working with most of my friends that worked at the same factory and became in twined with my friend circle, I couldn't escape.

My friends brother who is also a really good friend had a party, she brought a guy friend. I was also having a girl friend over but I couldn't handle it before she came. I was pretty drunk and don't remember the night.
Apparently I went to a store and bought 120 unisom tablets and ate them all. I also went up stairs (somehow) and told my parents after throwing up everywhere. I was rushed to the ER where I was treated and put into an involuntary clinic that dealt with suicidal attempts.

After I got out, life was great I would describe my feels as manic. I loved everything about life, especially after being held within a psych ward for 5+ days. No one knew what I did besides my best friend, life was great. I almost forgot to mention I messaged my friends sister while I was in the hospital and told her I wouldn't be around for a while, and I did something dumb and that I was in the hospital.

A week later I had a huge party, all my friends came out and it was great even though the sister brought her ""now ex"" which were just fuck buddies or some shit now. I had the girl I liked over, all was good I could flaunt that shit and make her jealous cuz she knew she was staying over and sleeping in my bed that night. And she was jealous, she had friends over and I could see them looking at me across the room knowing they were discussing drama which narcistically made me happy.

Fast forward a few weeks and I break things up with the girl while I'm shit faced and regret it, and in the end I lose her for good, life sucks. I then go to my friends after he gets off work (he works til 230 am along with the the sister) after I get there, she walks in with a guy who I know from their work who has a gf and still does so I don't think much of it. Later in the night after drinking (a pint+ of 100 proof captain) he says he's tired and goes to her room and she follows. I know she has a crush on him from dialogue from other parties that I didn't have time to fit into the story.

I flip out and my friend just says ""I don't know what to say"" I tell him peace out and just drive while drunk as hell.
I wound up at a store, end up buying 180 unisom and remember from before that I threw up after taking an excess amount of sleeping pills. I figured I'd take them in the back of my car, pass out on my back, throw up and die via choking on my own throw up. I've learned about these kinds of deaths studying criminal justice. I drove around crying trying to find a street for my ""resting place""

While this was going on my friend was texting me asking if I was alright, I told him I was killing myself and my good byes for the last time giving him my will and what I wanted him n others to have. He called my parents and told them the situation. They spam called and txted me, leaving voice mails but I was fading out by the sleeping pills. Even my friend called and left a voice mail crying which I listened to later and made me break down. I felt so peaceful and happy fading away into what I thought would be death, a pure bliss I wont feel again.

Turns out my parents called the police and they tracked my phone and found me. My friend who didn't have a working car at the time called his brother, told him what was going on and went out searching for me along with my parents. The police contacted my parents and told them they found me after contacting an ambulance. I apparently seized on the side walk after they brought me out of the car and rushed to the hospital.

I stayed there for 6 days while my levels dropped and was transferred to a psych ward. Being my second time at a ward I was a vet. I pretended to be happy, bull shitted everyone there and was released a day later.

Since then I haven't been the same, I no longer go to my friends place which is where all my friends hang out and party because I'm staying away from my trigger. Most everyone knows about my attempt now because my friend posted on Facebook I was going to the hospital and how it was a traatic night for him, rumors spread, all that bullshit. 

Now I'm embaraced to see anyone I know, not knowing of they know or not. I spend my time in my room contimplating suicide every minute of the day. I have nothing to do until I start work back on the 15th, just sitting here getting drunk and have ambitions to do anything in life. I've wished several times to absorb everyone's pain, disease, illness, and unleash it on me so I can die knowing I did something, but with no avail.

There's a whole lot more of connecting pieces and other bits and pieces that fit within my puzzle of suicidal intent but I don't feel like writing it, nor do I think people care. Caring only goes so far, everyone forgets or stops caring over time much like pain, but my pain is now and it out weighs any coping mechanism I have.

Sorry for any typos, I'm currently a pint+ down and looking for more so I can sleep and not have my brain think anymore.

I'm scared because I've never told anyone just how severely I hurt all the time and I told my girlfriend a year and some amount of months today just how bad it is and it felt good to get it off my chest but I also didn't want to burden her but she says I'm not a burden and she loves me and I don't know how to feel. I just want to know if help will actually help. Is there any form of support I can depend on outside of family? I have no money and I'm really scared but I really want to feel fully alive for the first time.

FelledWolf,5d8ix3,1479292008,Don't know what to do anymore.,"I don't even know where to start really, just getting my feelings out here feels kinda relieving, rather than keeping it bottled up. I just fuck up repeatedly, and it never stops. I put on a mask every single day, unable to tell anyone anything, because i'll get put under 24 hour watch (I'm in the army) and not be allowed to do anything. I take dxm on an almost daily basis because the dissociative feeling it gives me is the only thing that makes me, albeit temporarily, happy. I am 21m, I got married last year (impulsively, after my girlfriend of 7 years left me) and I can't stand her, as all she does is yell at me take my money, leave until late at night and I sleep on the couch. So all I do is work, abuse dxm, smoke, drink and play video games. My ""friends"" (I'd say more of, aquantinces or however you spell it) seem like they kind of care about my general wellbeing, but probably in a more universal or whatever way, as in you say you care about the people getting bombed in Syria, but you don't really care enough to do anything about it. My mother prides on the fact that I'm the most successful of all of her kids, when in fact, the only reason it seems like I'm successful is because I've spent 3 years in the army so far. In all reality, getting into the army is easy as fuck, and it's just a Band-Aid to having to take care of responsibilities on my own. I keep feeling this urge to just end it. I don't know what to do anymore. If you read this post, thanks I guess. I just need to lay this all down in writing somewhere."
yoshibestfan,5d8ttw,1479297789,I honestly don't see why I'm even trying at this point,"First off I want say that I'm not gonna be over exaggerating with anything.

Im fucked, truly fucked. I suffer from around 10 mental disorders and the diagnoses keep coming. Anxiety, depression, and ADD cripple me to the point where I can't even have a job, any job. I think about dying everyday and I really fantasise about it so much in every way. I have no will to live anymore. I jay walk across the highway with headphones on, I walk alone late at night, I eat shit food when I actually do eat, and I burn myself to relieve guilt. I feel like unless I either win a shit ton of money, or manage to live off of disability if they will even fucking give it to me, I'll never survive. I can't handle any responsibilities or outside stress because my brain gives me so much anxiety and stress that anymore makes me breakdown. I have mental breakdown on a fucking weekly basis. I've had depression and anxiety for the last 6 years and I'm only fucking 17. I severely struggle to keep relationships due to my anxiety, all the girls I've been with have left me. I have so many aspects of my personality that people hate, that I'm sure some shitty people out there would love to see that I've ended my pathetic life. If I actually said it all I bet I'd get hate or downvotes. I'm not a bad person, I mean, I actually kinda like who i am, but my mental disorders fuck me over for life. I try to be the best possible person and I'm never mean to anyone, half of my social anxiety revolves around worrying about hurting others. I really see no hope in ever sorting out my problems enough that I can live a normal life. I've been seeing councillors for 3 years and I'm on my 4th anti depressant. We all fucking die eventually, why the fuck should I stay alive knowing I'm bound to live a horrible life *and then* die?"
throwaway588324678,5foc25,1480490412,I just want someone to talk to...,"Hey guys... Making a shitpost here because I can't think of anywhere else to put it. I just feel so suicidal right now. I mean I have felt this way for years, but today coming home to my single parent in another drunken stupor (probably the 15th time this month, I've lost count) is just pushing me to a very dark place. She gets her welfare cheque and buys grog straight away. I'm sure you understand how depressing this is for me.

This time her drunken rambling included some barely intelligible nonsense about my father (who I know absolutely nothing about, and I don't think she does either). This is another trigger for me—I lament growing up in poverty with a dysfunctional alcoholic of a parent instead of an idyllic, happy, successful, married couple. And I especially lament being a bastard.

Anyway, while this triggered the post, everything else in my life is going awfully too—I have no friends, no job (can't even land a job at mcdonalds... I'm pathetic), I've achieved nothing whatsoever in life, not even passing high school, I don't even have a license let alone a car to drive, I've recently noticed a small cavity forming on one of my front teeth which is just absurd as I consume absolutely no soft drinks or candy/chocolate whatsoever, not even juice or cordial or perhaps anything sugary at all, and brush my teeth stringently twice a day, so that's just a total mystery. And I certainly can't afford a dentist right now or any time in the foreseeable future. Continuing on I'm not interested in anything that I can think of, as far as studying something to perhaps launch a career is concerned. Heh, hell, even things which I previously considered trivial, you know—things that didn't bother me—like my never having had a girlfriend at all throughout my teenage years, are all coming back to haunt me now. These are all the things which I think about when I'm walking home. I feel like my mind is on fire. I haven't been able to get these thoughts out of my head all for the past month or so.

All I feel like I can do these days is force myself to sleep all day to unconsciously pass what would otherwise be miserable time and collect unemployment benefits—which in Australia require attending a 'work for the dole' scheme—something that honestly feels like my one and only life jacket right now as it gives me something to do and gets me walking 10 kilometers per day. 

As much as I try to endure each new hardship, all the stars seem to be aligning into an eclipse of absolute misery. It's getting very hard to keep trudging on. I see no light at the end of the tunnel. I've reached a point where I feel like suicide would be a good way out. My better judgement knows what a folly suicide is; but despite this I just can't shake the feeling. I liken it to an educated economist who knows trade protectionism is a load of bullshit, but can't help wanting to implement it to help people who have lost their jobs due to free trade (strange analogy I know but it seems to fit well and it's the first thing that came to my head). I KNOW suicide isn't the answer, everyone with two brain cells to rub together will agree on this. And, hell, I know there have been people in far worse positions than me who have made it through. Yet that doesn't change the way I feel about it.

With my 20th birthday coming up soon I'm getting worried—seeing another milestone that would typically denote a new phase of happiness, success, camaraderie and just general life experience for most people, instead for me serve as just another depressing marker among a litany of depressing markers of perennial failure, loneliness and unemployment—might just be enough to push me over the edge and make me commit suicide which would be such an unfortunate, yet sadly inexorable lapse in judgement. And if it doesn't, by God will my 21st birthday probably generate that response.

Well there's the rant. This is all one big folly anyhow, I mean it's just words on the internet, but maybe you guys can say something that would cheer me up. Believe it or not, one of the things I seem to enjoy most these days isn't video games or movies like when I was a bit younger... It's listening to other people talk about their lives and what they've been up to. How things change."

Willisism,5dfqzf,1479388865,The End is Near,"I don't think I can last much longer. I have tried getting help, but it just doesn't make me feel better, it makes me feel worst. Since I was at a young age I felt like shit, but now it has gotten worst. I have no friends at school, no one to talk to, All i do is sit alone at lunch and not eat. I am failing behind on 2 online classes, while not turning in things in my other classes, which makes me think about suicide even more. I try and do stuff to take my mind off of suicide, but it just makes me want to die even more, because my parents would yell at me for skipping assignments and not turning them in. At those moments I can see that i am a disappointment and a failure to my family. My sister is a hard worker and is taking an internship with a doctor, while i'm here struggling to get through life. MY life has just dropped at his point, I think about suicide everyday, and at school I can't pay attention because all i think about is suicide. I don't get ready for tests, i just wing them. I think no one would care if i am gone, i am just a little spec in the universe, and we are all going to die in the future, why not just make it quicker. Even my grandma doesn't care if she dies, she knows that no one would care if she is gone. I have almost tried to kill myself on rough days, where I can't concentrate at school, and when I get home my parents yell at me, which is now getting more common throughout the week. I just live through a routine, where I go to school feeling like shit, and sitting in class, looking up ways to die. And when I get home, I get yelled at by my parents, and I just sit in my room tying a noose and thinking about suicide.. I think im just ready to leave at this point I think only one person would care if im gone, which is my best friend that I haven't seen or talked to in 3 years. No one likes me, and thinks i just kill myself and I might end it all at the end of this week...."
Dilsenberg,5b6ejt,1478295422,I Have Nothing...,"I've been feeling bad for years now. Starting small but gradually getting worse to the point where most of last year and this year, I've wanted to just die. I've posted here before feeling like garbage but I was essentially told that I still have things to live for blah blah. I somewhat believed it, thinking of my family and friends but never thought to myself. 

So I, this week, decided to take a look at my life. My family was away and I skipped my weeks classes saying I was ill to finally do what i want. I hate doing the usual things I do and I wanted a change. When it came to it however. I found that with all I have, I have nothing.

I have a job, a car, family, friends, and many possessions. But when I look at my life, I see clearly that most of them mean nothing. Obviously not family and friends. But everything else is just something to fill the void. There is nothing I enjoy. I never feel like I make a choice. 

I never wanted to drive, but my family made me so I could go out on my own. I realise I never go anywhere. I never wanted a job, but my family wanted me to earn my own money. I waste it on things of no value or importance to try and make myself happy. But I can't. 

On top of all that. I have no one to talk to about all this. If I tell my parents that I'm depressed again (I went in a very bad state when I was 16) they'll just assume I'm stressed with work or uni and tell me to get a grip like last time. My best friend has drifted away and my newer friends are not the people to talk about this stuff to. I would get in contact with my best friend, but it's just too awkward for me since I met her ""fiancé"". (If you haven't guessed, I fancy her a lot. One of the many reasons I hate myself). And I am not going to a doctor. Drugs don't help. When I was 16 and super depressed, I chunked down antidepressants like they were smarties. 

Speaking of smarties, I'm lactose intolerant. So I can't even eat what I want. All of my favorites foods gone in an instant. How did this come about? The doctor said it was most likely triggered by the stress I had been feeling. Fucking STRESS?! Jesus Christ. If that's true, I'm gonna be intolerant to fucking oxygen by the time im done writing this. Anyway, I digress.

I used to go to counseling. What a waste of time. I can sum up what they told me over a year and a half in four words. ""Don't think about it"". WOW THAT SOME GOOD ADVICE RIGHT THERE! 

""HEY EVERYONE, DO YOU FEEL BAD? WELL JUST DON'T!""

So, to conclude, I have nothing. No choice. No one to talk to. Nothing important to me. 

I take that back. I do have one choice. Whether I live or die. And man, does die sound like a great option."
aSadArtist,5d9owy,1479309371,Sorry for the long bullcrap but I had to let out everything I kept in for decades,"I know, I'm far from being the most miserable person in this world, but I can't help but think I'm a sad and useless oaf who's better off dead. I'm trying a lot of things now, but I don't think I can bear with the stress if things don't change for the better. I'm nearly 30 and this is a description of my life up till now. I'm very sorry for the *ridiculously* long post but I just want to leave something behind.

I was an awkward person even from a young age, and kept to myself almost all the time. I tried to mimic classmates so as to 'blend in' to my surroundings in an attempt to make friends--playing games I don't enjoy, putting up 'masks' and acting loud and outgoing just like everyone around me even though I am bad at communication, etc... but I stopped doing that one day because it felt empty and artificial. I tried my best to make friends while 'being myself', but it didn't work out. I'm the kind that has no presence (ironically, despite being much taller than the average over here) and charisma. Could be because of my hobbies, which aren't common, and my lack of interest in stuff the kids my age back then are typically interested in (eg. shopping, cars, fashion, celebrities, etc). These friends formed their own 'sub-circles' within the one big group I was in, and while I 'hang out' with them at times, I wasn't in any of them. You could say I was alone all these time (my best friend is my family dog).

I'm aware that I'm fairly abnormal compared to others, and while I don't think it's that visible to others, I might be wrong about it. People around me (even my parents) sometimes think I might be homosexual since I don't seem to be interested in girls, but I'm straight; it's not that I'm not interested in girls, I just have no interest in people in general. Even the thoughts of having a girlfriend (I *had* a girlfriend as a teenager, but it didn't last) leads me to the question of whatever the hell 'love' means.

I was a top student back in middle school and while an awkward person, I had confidence in my academics and many people had high hopes for me. I put in a lot of effort into studying because I enjoy learning. This changed during my first year in high school because I couldn't focus in class anymore after getting exposed to gaming (something which is both the joy and the bane of my life). I aced all the subjects during the first half of the year, but I flunked them all in the latter half; teachers talked to me about how they think I have the smarts but I just didn't put in enough effort, etc, but that didn't change me for the following 3 years. My grades did improve in the last year when I started making more effort so as to get into a better school, but not nearly enough. I did score enough to enter the colleges with the lowest requirements, but I chose to enter a vocational school instead, due to my personal interest in pursuing something I want to do (game design) and also due to dumb pride as well, not wanting to enter a 'last resort' sort of college.

I fully understood what I was getting into (a ton of programming and geeky work), but my peers didn't. Most of them entered the course thinking it would be fun since it's about 'game design'. I got pulled into the mood and for two years, I fooled around and played games with them even during class (i.e. what I mentioned earlier about blending in), and did poorly academically. Only during the third year did I try to buck up and put in 100% effort, but it was too late since the credits from all the semesters are added and averaged. I loved my experience in school (I like designing games), but I also regret entering the course because it's a **very** technical course where it's ridiculously hard to score compared to other courses. I ended up with a below-average 2.92 GPA (still in the top few of my class), which isn't very far from 3.0, yet the difference in the whole numbers was worlds apart. I applied for the local universities that offered courses in game designing or computer sciences, but was rejected flatly. To this date, I still don't have a university qualification (something quite critical where I live).

During all this time, I picked up a ton of skills (mostly computer-related) in my free time and I can say that I'm pretty much a jack-of-all-trades, but a master of none in the sense that I have no qualifications to show for it. I also started to communicate a lot with people I got to know online, and made a lot of 'friends' over the world (also when I started polishing my writing skills, people over here aren't particularly good at the language). Funnily, I get along with these people better than the people I know in real life. My online life also gave me a sense of existence.

***
I feel that I have a lot of problems myself, but I've never managed to get appropriate help regarding these. Almost all the time I would get the typical ""don't worry, you're just overthinking it"" response, which certainly doesn't help. Not expecting advice regarding them here but allow me to list them down just for the sake of it (maybe as a form of wallowing in self-pity):

1. Terrible memory, having trouble remembering names and matching names to faces (it took me more than a month to remember the names of 20 classmates), I have completely no sense of direction, I forgot almost everything I've learned in school which makes me feel like I wasted my life doing nothing.
2. I have good hearing, but I can't pick up words properly (which upon a search, suggests I might have auditory processing disorder). It hurts when people don't understand and tend to get annoyed, replying ""never mind"" when I politely ask if they could repeat their words. I'm not sure when this started happening either, but it's a **major source of misery for me and it makes a dent in my self-confidence**. I have a fear of talking over the phone because it gets especially bad through the phone.
3. I've had sleeping disorders for over a decade. I can fall asleep at the most inappropriate times without control (especially when I *don't want to* fall asleep), but have difficulty getting to sleep at night or in environments I'm not used to (I once went 3 days without sleep). I saw a specialist but he don't help; it felt like the hospital just wanted to milk money out of me since I was never given a proper diagnosis (besides saying ""it *could* be narcolepsy""), only given pills and was asked to go back for more 'consultations'.

I got into a traffic accident in the last year of vocational school, something no one except my family believed me in because I didn't go to hospital (i.e. no medical record). To be fair, I would be pretty skeptical myself if someone told me he was flung 10 feet after getting hit by a pickup truck, but stood up fine afterward. I was hit in the right side of my body. Besides a laptop screen that completely shattered, a missing wristwatch that apparently got flung out onto the road from the impact, and some scratches, I felt fine so I went on as per normal, but some stuff possibly came back to haunt me later on. It's also possible that the accident could be the cause for some of my problems above, but no one knows. I think I also left a poor driver feeling guilty even though it wasn't his fault (I was jaywalking).

***
I live in a place where men are required to conscript in the army. During the medical examination, they noted that my backbone was slightly misaligned to one side, but it shouldn't be much of a problem. I didn't think too much of it, and went for basic military training. I tried to remain low-profile and but of all places they could send me to after basic training course, these people just had to send me to one of the most physically demanding elite divisions (it's probably because of sheer dumb luck). I was out of training for six months since my backbone got worse and worse, but after that they threw me back in training since the doctors didn't want to do anything about it. It's also partially my fault for not voicing out strongly about my condition. By the time military training ended, my back was compressed bad enough to the point that I cannot stand for more than 90 minutes or so without a terrible pain, and the nerves affect my right knee too (I now walk with a limp at times when my knee goes 'dead' all of a sudden). Years of training in which I spent more time in jungles than camp had to be part of the reason why I couldn't remember a speck of the stuff I learned in school as well.

It's not so bad if that was the end, but we have to go through a decade of reservist, with yearly military training that go on for a couple of weeks (intensity of the training depends on your division). Also, we have fitness evaluations which decide whether or not you have to go through stupid fitness training sessions throughout the year (affecting your civilian life); needless to say I fail these tests every time, having a busted backbone. I want to get a certificate from doctors to show that I'm not fit for these things anymore (I've already given enough to the country without getting anything in return), but I think I'm either bad at describing my condition or these doctors simply don't want to listen. I certainly don't want to exaggerate my condition either (I'm very stubborn about never lying). I've spent quite an amount seeing these doctors as well, who either end up giving me advice on stretching my body or giving me physiotherapies which never did anything besides wasting time. Administration in my division was crap as well; I was the only person among the hundreds to have my appointment within the section changing every year for odd reasons, which adds on to my stress since I already have problems remembering my roles every year as it is.

***
My father was a high flyer when I was still a toddler, but an overseas business venture failed and he almost went bankrupt. We moved several times, each time into a smaller apartment (what he got from the selling of the previous went into his gambling addiction). He was later diagnosed with cancer by one hospital, and after surgery, was ensured they removed it proper. He turned over a new leaf, borrowing money to start a small business. It eventually failed and he almost went bankrupt a second time, and we had to move into an even smaller apartment. My family was initially bitter about it, but I was very happy that he turned for the better.

Many months later, we went to another hospital after symptoms resurfaced and got worse; they told us that the cancer wasn't completely removed and it was in Stage IV by the time he got them to check. That was during the last year of my military training years. He suffered for a half a year at home, and got hospitalized after it got worse. Doctors told us there was nothing they could do to help besides surgeries which would only serve to extend his life (and suffering). They told us about an experimental R&amp;D drug (I think it was a drug, can't remember for sure) which they were looking for patients who are willing to take, which if successful, could cure him for good. However, it would be fatal if it fails and the success rate was just 15~20%. We discussed it through with him and after **much** thought, decided to go for it. I still remembered we celebrated his birthday about a week in advance (the doctors gave us some time before he took it). At that time I thought I wouldn't mind giving up my life just for the drug to succeed. He didn't make it, passing away the same day. My family was devastated and I hated the army even more than I already did, for taking time away from me when I could have spent it with my father in his last years. The higher-ups did some stuff as well, almost causing me to not make it in time for his last breath. *He may not be the best father, but I loved him all the same.*

***
My goal throughout my entire life was giving my parents a good life, and half of it was taken away from me before I even had the chance to do so. It broke me, and for years to come, I wallowed in self-pity. After I got out from the army I looked for jobs, but none stuck with me for long. I secured a high-paying job in a startup firm through a friend's recommendation, but I backed out at the last minute because I didn't think I was up to the task (it was a pretty high position). I even got into a job completely irrelevant to my studies because I was desperate, and I left within a few months after falling out with the boss (to be fair, the boss was a piece of work and even the veterans in the firm wanted to leave because they couldn't take his holier-than-thou attitude anymore). I went on to do freelance copywriting, scripting and graphics designing from home, and even though I understood I was escaping from reality, I continued to do it despite it barely earning me enough to eat. This lasted for a couple of years, and I go out so seldom that I'm essentially a shut-in (I only go out to get groceries). This is the point I'm currently at. I'm fed up with it and I finally decided to start with a proper work again so that I can earn enough to let my mother retire and live in comfort. I'm currently looking for jobs but I'm being stupidly stubborn about sticking with basic jobs in the game industry and/or graphic design. There *are* jobs like these which don't require experience (albeit rarely), but putting myself in these recruiters' shoes, I can understand why they're hesitant in giving this guy with years of gap in his resume a call.

I'm not afraid of death itself, but I'm afraid of leaving behind the one person I care for: my mother. My mother isn't young anymore, and she's very worried about how I would be alone when she goes. To be honest (and I don't plan on telling her this because it would just add on to her worries), when she does go, there's nothing else keeping me from death so even if I find a reason now, I would be grasping at straws simply to find another later on."

I'm too much of a POS to get a job, or clean, or do anything productive at all. I'm too afraid to leave this room, if I do I have to at least wash my hands and feet. For some reason I start screaming and grunting whenever a bad thought crosses into my mind or something upsetting happens. I'm also lonely now, because my cat recently died. I used to play video games to relieve stress and distract myself, but I can't, because I'm too dumb to make myself go into my room because I think there is mold or something in there, even though there probably isn't. I just want all of this to end. I wish there was someone who understands me. It seems like everyone is doing everything they can to irritate me. They always talk to me and ask questions and it may seem nice for you guys, but I HATE talking to people. It takes so much out of me. It's so difficult to have a conversation. I just want to be normal. I wish I could get a job and just move into a small little apartment somewhere and maybe get a dog. That's all I want. I want to be normal. I hate everything about myself. I've tried to get people to help me, I tried to go to the ER in hopes they would do something, but I lied to them last second and bitched out, just like me. I lie to everyone that wants to help. I'm probably addicted to my pills, but at the same time I don't know. I'm not sure. I think I just like them. They make me feel at least somewhat normal regardless of all of the side effects. It's better than how I was without them. I want to play games again. I want to distract myself. Doctors keep wanting to change my pills. I just want to stay. Why did I have to be born at all? I'm the third try my parents had, the 1st one is actually successful, the 2nd was a miscarriage. They should've taken the 2nd one as a sign. I'm a mistake, I'm fucked up in the brain, I can't do anything physically, I sincerely cannot do anything. I have nothing I am good at. I hate it. Everything is bad."

i had never felt that way before, but i was home alone and it was so late and i didn't have any friends to call. so naturally, i tried the hotline that my therapist gave me a month before. 

i sat in my garage having one of my panic attacks, because i didn't want to scare my dogs inside the house. i waited for someone to pick up, and... i sat on hold for two hours. 

it was now around 6 in the morning, and a woman talked to me for a while. i don't know why i waited so long. maybe i was too much of a pussy to die and i'm sorry about that if it devalues my story. more than anything, i'm surprised it took so long for someone to answer.. i can only imagine that that would have been the end for so many other people.

idonteatbugs04,5c94io,1478799411,no one believes I'm not okay. I guess they'll realize too late.,"I was in the hospital recently. Just got out a week ago. So I have a really intensive care team and I'm supposed to be going to an intensive day program. I've told all the staff there, the psychiatrist, and my personal therapist that I don't feel I'm coping well at all, and that I'm having thoughts of hurting and killing myself. I told them I can't do the program anymore; they didn't believe me. I called a hotline and was even sent to the ER last night. They just said the same thing, to take it ""one day at a time"", and sent me home feeling worse than before.

I feel invalidated by all the professionals in my life. I feel as though I've failed the system and therefore I'm weak and deserve to die. I can't function. I can't sleep or eat. I've started cutting myself again and it doesn't feel like enough. I'm torn between feeling like they don't get it and like it's all my fault. I don't have a set plan to die, but I have lots of ideas and impulses floating around in my brain and it's only a matter of implementing them - I'm not going to make a ""plan"". I'm going out of town tonight because if I don't I'll probably take all my prescription sleeping pills and I want to put that off until I get away and see if there's anything left in life for me.

I feel bad, sometimes think about suicide but there's stuff holding me from doing it, which is good, I guess.    
     
What holds me is that there's things I want to do, that I'm kind of afraid of death and there was already a suicide in my family so I kind of know how awful it is but at the same time I think that why should I care about that, I'll be that, why should it matter it someone else feels bad because I'm gone? Should I keep living just because what everyone else may feel?  
    
Why should I keep studying? I feel like I'm wasting time and my parents money because I'll never accomplish anything

When I go out with people, I feel like I don't belong there, despite what they say    
  
I feel like I don't have any friends, I don't speak to anyone else besides my internet 'friends', and the people I know irl, only message me to ask something and if I do message them, the conversations feel cold, but probably is because of me, I don't know exactly how to speak with people, the only ones I'm able to speak with fluidity is the ones in the internet, I only feel comfortable with them but at the same time I feel like a lie and i'm afraid of the day they find out I don't have a dick.   
   
I don't like going out, besides the stuff mentioned earlier, I'm always afraid to go to the bathroom.

Shinzo_Yokai,5equbk,1480034263,I can't go on anymore... I'm just a burden and a troublemaker.,"I'm nothing but trash... If I could kill myself painlessly; perhaps pass in my sleep, I would. This sadness is unrealistically overwhelming to the point where I needed to grab a knife.

A summary of why I've been so upset is... First and foremost, my inability to speak to people. I'm always afraid that if I vent out my frustrations to my friends, they'll eventually get sick of me. And I can never vent out my issues to my family or parents, because they wouldn't understand, or blame me for getting myself into this mess.

Today I get a message from somebody I know; they find out that there's a chatlog full of people whom I considered my friends for about 4 years now, all except one is saying terrible things about my character. The phrase ""attention whore"" comes to mind often when they talk about how much they dislike me.

The majority believed that all I do is complain and complain without hearing the complaints of others. Even though I do sit down and heed the issues and worries of my friends, I'm still treated as though I'm but a leech. I can't even say they're wrong anymore...

I was given a screenshot of my supposed boyfriend calling me a moody, edgy, emotional slut, while bragging about the nudes he'd just snagged from me. I had texted him earlier and asked him if he had told anyone about it, and he lied to my face. I'm nothing but a toy...

My friend didn't get these screenshots on his own, there's some bastard going around on different alternate accounts from a social media site I was on; he threatened to ruin people who exposed his alternate accounts, and I ended up getting caught in the crossfire when I realized it was somebody who was just grooming me and using me.

By this point, he's using the screenshots as blackmail for me, my friend, and basically anyone who was in the group chat. He wants to blackmail my friend for something ""illegal"" that he did (I was never told what it was in the first place...) And I've probably screwed myself too.  Considering that we and some others already suspected that this stalker compromised several of my accounts already and won't leave me alone. So I can't even talk to the people who spoke harshly about me behind my back. Says that he wants me to stop talking to everyone and anyone in his circle of friends.

My social anxiety has been getting worse and worse over the past few months, and now I believe it's hitting sort of an apex... I just want to shut it all off. Not just because I'm upset, but this sheer anger and hatred I have for this person is consuming me enough to rot my mind. 

My parents cannot help me this time. It's been a long time coming; I just want to sleep and never wake up. I almost need to bleed myself out, so I don't feel this burning pain all across my body.

And whenever I think of reaching out to a random person, I get a horrid feeling of dread. I hate social anxiety so much, and it's destroying me. However, my parents don't see this as a problem...

I wanted to keep my mouth shut about my issues, because I'd feel like a whiner when other people go through much worse than I do. When I was around 13 I had been on a social media platforms that's meant to help troubled people come together and prevail, but it was full of people who would inevitably drive me into a great deal of stress. I thought I had escaped that when I moved over to a different platform years later. I wasn't right in the slightest...

---

I have little to live for now, noting that I've also been struggling getting enjoyment out of activities that I considered something that I've enjoyed doing. A minuscule fraction of my ""friends"" actually cares for me and my well being, my boyfriend doesn't appreciate me and finds me annoying...

And I ever mentioned such heavy feelings to my parents, they'd ask me to pray; regardless of the fact that I told them I'm agnostic, which, they just can't seem to understand OR respect.

Please...

I don't want to die...but at this rate, I have no choice anymore... I can't hold back this knife forever."
sinceweresmokey,5d03tt,1479177066,Nil,"I have been thinking about suicide for a long time now. I have indicated to a few people in person and online that I might end up doing it, but I haven't received any satisfactory responses. It seems like people fail to understand that their automatic responses have no significance. Same thing applies to support hot lines. If I was not afraid and I had the means to buy a shotgun or a CO tank I would have possibly done it already.

I am looking for a job, and it's not going well.

The last rejection mail I received basically stated that I was unqualified for the general CS position. It's like my worst fear came true. They suggested studying from a certain book, which I have already been studying for a month now. Go figure.

If I don't find a job in a certain amount of time I will get deported.

I have been offered a job for next semester at my university, which many people think that I should accept as a safety net. But it's the type of job I have no interest in doing anymore.

I am sick of academia and dealing with students.

I am out of patience with people. I am afraid I will snap really bad soon.

I have never had a job that I truly enjoyed.

I am constantly stressed, my back hurts all the time.

I have been dealing with anxiety and depression for years. Never been diagnosed officially, because I don't have money to see a doctor. But I have been going to counseling services and been on medication for more than 6 years.

I don't have a good support mechanism. 

I don't have real friends. It may be my fault, because I stayed away from people for a long time. There are people around me, but when the weekend comes there is nobody to spend a few hours with.

I don't have a good relationship with my family.

I am gay. I came out late in life, and the family members I told about it haven't been supportive.

I am from a homophobic country. There are no rules against gay people, but it is practically impossible to hold another man's hand in public without the possibility of getting harassed, at least verbally in the best case. There is no way I can have an open and peaceful life where I am from.

I am lonely. I am having a very hard time handling it.

I am a member of a minority in my country that many people flat out hate.

I had a very hard time growing up. I was bullied for years and I could not tell anyone about it, ironically to protect myself.

I am not fond of my country, its people or its culture.

I am broke. Sometimes I have trouble affording food.

I have hospital bills I am having trouble paying. I may have to deal with collections soon.

I can't afford the medical care that I need. At the very least I need to get some dental procedures done, and I need to see a psychologist and a psychiatrist.

I have serious body image issues.

I have no hobbies.

I am judgmental.

I am not a good person.

I am almost 32 and completely disappointed with myself. When I look back all I see is a waste of time. I have spent my last 13 years on higher education and put everything on hold, which apparently was for nothing. I turned into the type of person I despised. I honestly do not see things getting any better. I wish I could at least die in peace.

Oh, and I had been told I might have PTSD."
Omnicross,5aoe23,1478067073,"Failed an attempted suicide 4 days ago, but am thinking that tonight is the night.","Hello,

I am not really sure what to say on here.  For years now (going on 10 *am 22*), I have had no real desire to live in this world anymore.  This is not a suicide note, as I have already spent many years putting mine together, but more of a release of emotions, something I wish everyone in my life knew about me, and what I cannot post on facebook, as it would look like me just whining or calling for attention.  I am a failure in everything, a son, boyfriend, friend, co-worker, advisor, tutor, everything.

I am 22 years old and still live at home.  Yes I do some things such as pay rent, pay my phone bill, have a part time job, a high school diploma, and other small insignificant things, but there is so much that I do not have and constantly fail at.  I was never a good student in school, and while bright and intelligent, the public education system crushed my love for learning, and I let my grades fail all throughout high school, I couldn't even pass/make it through my first year of college.  I do not have a car, license, or even a permit for that matter.  I am not currently in school as I am terrified of returning and failing and wasting money, as well as not being sure what exactly I want to go back for.  I do not have friends anymore, as most of them left after high school to do their own things, and I am not sure how to make friends anymore.  I have a part time job where I am lucky if I get enough hours to make maybe $250 dollars every other week, just barely enough for me to pay my phone bill, rent, and put a little aside for savings.

I cannot hold down a relationship, most of it probably having to do with my high chronic depression, trust issues, and low self esteem, and recently was just dumped from a 4 month relationship from a very important girl in my life who I have known my whole life.  My own family realizes that I am a failure, and am constantly berated by my siblings for graduating a year late, my mother for only having a part time job and no real ambitions, and most importantly myself, as I KNOW that I am worth nothing and have a bleak future. 

I don't really know what else to say, or even why I have said anything at all.  I do not feel happy in the slightest anymore.  I no longer feel joy in movies, video games, walks, music, company of others, working out, or even eating or sleeping.  My future holds no meaning, and nothing substantial.  Even if I did decide to continue on and try to start a family, it would not work as women do not pay me any attention due to me being pretty short for a guy.

There is so much more to say, but there is really no point anymore.  I just really want to throw an apology out there into the world for being a waste of space and a disappointment.

To those of you who feel the same way or have/are dealing with the same things I am, I pray that you can be a stronger person then I am."

I have no friends to turn to for help since I've never had any. That's right. 21 and never had a friend. Pretty sad, right? Anyways, I know I should get help.

I realistically have nothing stoping me now every morning I wake up older, lost more of my hair, lost more of my youth and I realize at at 21 that my life is going nowhere and I can't do anything to change it. my GPA is shit, my family is Apathetic, and I can safely say nobody miss me, so why should I keep going.

queenbethany_97,5b8065,1478315587,I'm Tired of Being Tired...,"People keep telling me it gets better. For six or more years, that's all I've heard. ""It gets better, just hang in there!"" Did aspects get better? Yeah. I met a girl that I love with all my heart, I got an amazing dog, and I'm going to college.

In all honesty, some of that just makes these feelings worse. I had cut so many people out of my life at the end of high school. The only people that might have missed me would have been my family, and even on bad days that is questionable. Now, though, I have so many connections again. Friends, a girlfriend, her family, a dog that depends on me for food and care...

It doesn't help make the days better when you have anxiety and depression. It just makes the days longer. I'm mentally exhausted. I take 15 credit hours at school, work part time, and have to handle my girlfriend and my dog. I want to make her happy to the best of my ability, even if it means staying up late to drive home after being with her and waking up early the next day for work. I have friends to care for. Everyone seems to have it harder than me.

I'm just so...tired of being this exhausted. I'm tired of waking up every morning and feeling this way. I don't think I'm actually in danger of killing myself, but the thoughts cross my mind. Almost daily I think about how it might happen. Would I succeed? Would I fail, end up in the hospital? Who would cry? Who would say they saw it coming? I never have an urge to act out these thoughts, but the maladaptive daydreams I have consume me.

It's getting harder every day. Every night I want to bury my head in my pillow and scream. It's harder and harder to ignore the urge to rake a blade over my skin and feel the sting of pain because, hey, at least I can feel that. I feel nothing but static all day. I just want to sleep and never wake up. I can't leave these people I have to take care of, but I'm so tired...

If you got this far, I would really like to talk to someone who understands. I want to tell my girlfriend, but she also has anxiety and depression. I'm trying not to make it worse by telling her how much I'm actually struggling. She already threatened to take me to a mental hospital once..."
Deciding11,5b83kl,1478317026,Backed into a corner,"I feel like I've backed myself into a corner, and suicide is the only way out. I think about it constantly; it's like a physical thing reverberating in my head.

I'm not smart enough, or diligent enough, or ready for the responsibility. It's all I've focused on my whole life- skipping out on so much more in pursuit of this goal, and now I'm finally seeing that it's out of reach. Without this, i don't know what to do. I don't know who I am. 

The prospect of trying to build a new life from the ashes seems impossible. I've never wanted anything else. A life continued would seem so pointless, and I would move through each day wearing a brand of failure. I can't make myself want that.

Spunkmasterc,5e293g,1479703232,Not seeing the light,"I'm in a tough grad program. Its for my dream career, but I'm starting to slip. My dad killed himself a number of years ago, I'm using his inheritance, its not much... But just enough to pay for the program if I work on the weekends. My work is irregular and sucks I'm not getting the shifts I need and my boss is nuts. This weekend was my birthday, my mother as a gift rented out a cabin in the woods, I invited over 20 peoples, over 15 confirmed and only two showed up. We couldn't make it to a concert or an event because the weather closed the roads I invited the girl I'm head over heels for and she bailed.. I've had relations with her before, and she always leaves me out to dry. Right now I'm 25 in debt, alone, without a career and on the verge of failing out of my program. 

I've always been unlucky, people say ""you create your own luck"" but I've broken 17 bones, and I live with a chronic disease that gives me almost constant dull pain. I asked a girl to marry me once, she left me for another man. My family has never been financially well off, I relied heavily on local charities for clothing and food growing up. 

I've always been depressed, on my fire crew I even earned the nickname of ""Blue"" because I'm known to be melancholy. I've just never been this depressed or hopeless. I thought that people cared about me, they don't, the girl doesn't either."

I've been a lazy piece of shit for as long as I can remember. I skated through high school, I tired to skate through college and fucked that up bad. I joined the military after I got arrested, which means that all of those cool jobs that I could have gotten in the military were thrown out the window. I picked some rando shit job, met my husband in boot and got married in A school. I was too much of a pussy for the military and checked myself into the hospital for mental issues. Half of me thinks i'm a lying sack of shit who quit the military the other half thinks I have a legit condition. Now here I am out of the navy no skills and my spouse is still in the navy and I hate every second of it. Every time I hear he had a bad day at work or worse he recently got hurt on the job I feel it, I feel the guilt. I find myself chain smoking and beating myself up, thinking it should have been me. 

I want so badly to atone,  I wish I could go back and trade places with my husband. Not because I miss it cause I fucking hate the military, the wars, all of it. Veterans day makes me cringe. I just want to be a part of something. 

These days I spend my time trapped with no friends at my mother in laws, If there was a god I'd tell him ""I just want some fucking meaning in my life please, give me a direction!"" All this find your passion bullshit, it's all a crock of lies. I'll never know what it means to have a dream. 

Why am I here this whole damn bore fest that is my life is already too far gone, If I had a dream I'd never be able to get there anyway. I wish I'd just die, i'm so bored day in and day out, I hate myself, and I can't change anything no matter what i do. The rest of my life will be just like this, years and years of monotony, apathy, and never being quite alright. Rotting away in front of a screen while people who are luckier than show off how good they have it.

I really don't want any of what comes next, and its been that way for as long as I can remember. Is it possible for a person to be depressed for a whole life?

But I also can't say I don't understand why someone would think to end their life. Life is a privilege and something that should be cherished, but over the past 10 years, it's been hard to shake the idea if a majority of your time is spent depressed, what is the point? 

Ever since I was 18 I've been unhappy. I always felt it has been for set reasons, work, relationships, etc. And I would always tell myself give it time. Things will change. For the most part, life does change, so when I hear of people in their teens thinking about killing themselves, I see it as a myopic viewpoint. But for me, now at age 35 and soon to be 36, I'm not sure how I can keep believing that things will in fact ever change. I've never let it stop me from trying, but over the last 6 years, I feel it ever day, that I'm losing hope, inch by inch. I'm a successful person in my career, but sadly it is the only thing I have. I'm alone. I never really dated much growing up and there's been blips of dating here and there but for the most part, I have no one. I recently came out of a relationship of 8 months, longest time for me, but that ended. And I know people can think this is a outcry based on that, but it's more yet another thing that only supports that nothing will ever work out. It scares me to think about leaving this world, but doesn't there have to be a point when it's just not worth it anymore? I keep trying and trying...but at some point it honestly just seems foolish, I know I can keep going and chug along, but what kind of life is that when you just become numb, when your life is so devoid of any heart.

If you don't you're marginalized and considered mentally ill. But mental illness is a coping mechanism. It's a response. The toxicity lies not inside the head but outside. My reality is toxic. There IS NO response except mental illness and suicide. "
Wolf9455,5cx15n,1479143384,Guilt Suicide,"I'm a 29 year old white male with a great job and college degrees. I have two loving parents - they're divorced but both alive and supportive of me. We all live in different states, but we recently were all together because I almost died in a motorcycle accident. 

So I owe the rest of the loan on the motorcycle. The person who hit me didn't have car insurance so all the bills ($150,000+) are going to mine. My bike was totaled..that was the last thing I can think of enjoying in my life..riding the bike. I would buy another one today if I could afford it. I couldn't afford the first one, though, so I owe a couple grand for a bike I don't get to touch anymore.

I'm manic/depressive, and a couple months before the accident I had stopped taking my medication. So when I got hit, I was carrying a concealed pistol and over 2 ounces of marijuana. I don't sell drugs, I'm a medical patent, but I was in a paranoid hypomanic state. I had no real reason to be carrying a gun besides that I live in Detroit. The accident resulted in a lot of broken bones and another closed head injury. The head injury is the main culprit for my suicidal ideation. 

Two years prior to this accident, I was jumped by a group of MMA fighters outside a bar in Columbus, OH. They crushed my skull in seven places and caused brain damage to my prefrontal cortex. Immediately following that head injury I became intensely suicidal. I was in the last year of graduate school, so there was some pressure from that. Against all previous philosophical reasoning, I began an antidepressant (Prozac). Before I felt this way, I had always thought depression was just something in people's mind's that they were responsible for fostering it and weak for allowing it to continue. 

The Prozac made me manic - this was my first experience with a manic episode, so I blame the head injury. The psychiatrist that proscribed the Prozac left his job before he could see how it affected me. This mania lasted about 8 months. In those 8 months, I alienated a longterm girlfriend and almost every single one of my other friends and acquaintances. I ran a marathon and rode a 180 mile bike race. Then I got suspended from the lab at school because someone told my professor I was selling drugs and carrying a gun. After being suspended from the lab, I hashed out my thesis in coffee shops, shisha lounges, and libraries - until they banned me from the school library for acting outrageous. I also traveled back and forth from Florida 6 or 7 times in the new Mustang GT I just bought with zero down on credit. 

The whole time I was being followed by the CIA and FBI. There were also people from competitive industries trying to steal my thesis. I saw them in cars with ear pieces; I saw them in every coffee shop or shisha lounge. I saw them flying Cessna planes overhead every 20-30 mins. Driving back and forth from Florida, my average speed was 100+mph. If it was dark and I saw them, I would switch off all my lights and rocket down the freeway in complete darkness, sometimes flying past the occasional car in darkness. Through all of this, I was able to finish and defend my thesis - by the grace of God.

So I racked up about $25k in debt during the manic episode, which doubled what I already owed mainly for school. The financial stress is huge – my bank account is negative $600 as we speak, and I just opened another $500 bill from the accident. I’ve had one surgery and I’m scheduled for another surgery Nov 30. The first court date for the felony is Dec 16. 

I’m also in a turning point decision at work. I’m ending a rotation program for new hires and I need to make a decision about where I want to spend the next few years.. it has been real hard to consider any of the options because I can’t get it out of my head that I’m just going to end it. There’s no use for making plans when I’m not going to be there.

These are a couple of the immediate stresses. The reasons I can’t get by them is I have diminished self-confidence. My heart was broken by a girl I hoped to spend my life with. It was broken again by my friends and family when I was submitted to a psych ward during my manic phase. I didn’t believe there was a problem – thought everyone else had the problem. The 7 days on that ward changed everything about my life for the worse. I refused any treatment and they released me with an unclear diagnosis. I have a very deep-seeded self-hatred. Part of this is just because I’m a human – and I have a philosophical hatred for the human race, stemming from our lack of compassion, tendency to take advantage or others, destruction of the planet, and on and on. I hate the job I landed because it represents everything I was against as a youth...I have no money. I have nothing to show for the work I’ve done. Every plan I have is fickle. I hate the people I work with for being normal. I hate the city and state I live in. I hate the “work” I do. I have no physical outlets anymore because of my injuries. I don’t want to have a child because I don’t trust my genetics and I don’t want to bring another human into this fucking circus. I can’t drink because I’m an alcoholic and because of the meds…so I don’t know how to meet people anymore. I used to like my coworkers when I had a regular job – met some of my best friends in pizza shops. Now just talking to someone here makes me feel like shit about myself.

dik7630,5dmwdx,1479482160,The guilt is killing me. Can't bear to take this anymore,"I am a 25 year old male. Until 6 months ago, I was deeply and madly in love with a girl. I had known her for more than 2 years and we had been together for about 1.5 years, and were living together this whole time. I had been in and out of love before, had had girlfriends before her, but she was different. It may sound cliched, but I really mean it when I say that it felt like she and I were just made for each other, and I really haven't seen any couple as perfect as what we were.

One fine Sunday morning, we woke up, had a fun shower together and got ready to go shopping. Then suddenly there was a little misunderstanding, and it grew into a serious fight (most of you probably know how these things are). The fight got serious, and she told me to get out of the house. I refused, saying I wouldn't until she apologizes to me. She didn't like the way I talked (justifiably so), and she slapped me across the face.

That was the first time she had ever hit me. I thought it was unfair of her to have hit me like that. I felt I was the one trying to solve things, instead of turning the other person out of the house. I felt she was the one making things worse by using violence or by ending conversation by kicking me out. I don't know if I was right or not, but I have decided that it doesn't matter, at least not as much as compared to what happened next.

I threatened her to not do that again, in harsh words. A second later, another slap landed on my cheek. This, I decided was just not done. A couple of seconds passed. I can't remember what went on in my head in those 2 seconds, but I have never had a more stupid moment in my life ever. I rose up, and slapped her on her cheek. It was a hard one. Much harder than the ones she gave me.

Her face turned red, mouth opened, she let out a cry. It was a mixture of pain and disbelief. More disbelief, as was clear from her expression. How could the love of her life, who she was planning to have children and grandchildren with until a few minutes ago, do this to her?

When the reality hit me; when I realized what I had done, I felt like killing myself then and there. I remember trying to stop her from going out the house, but in a couple moments she was already out and on phone with her best friend who lived almost next door. Before I could do anything, she was in her best friend's house, crying so loudly I could hear her for a long time. I went back inside, and picked up a kitchen knife to slash my left wrist. I couldn't live with what I had done. I don't know what stopped me; whether it was cowardice or intelligence, but I regret today of not having completed the deed then and there.

180 days have passed since. All this time, I have replayed the above over and over in my head, countless number of times. Whether I'm at work, home, with parents, friends... I am always replaying those couple hours in my head, thinking of the one thing I could have done which would have stopped this chain of events. All these 180 nights, of the nights I have been able to sleep, I have had nightmares relating to the same incident.

We hadn't spoken or had any communication since that day, until today. Today I received an email from her, a very short one. She is moving out of town, and hopes to never see me again in her life. The only memory she will have of this town and of me is the evening when I hit her, and ruptured her ear drum.

I did not know that until today. I knew I had slapped her hard, but to have caused real physical harm? No way. I was in office when I got this email. I rushed to the rest room and threw up. 180 days of guilt was already tough to deal with, now to know that I didn't even know how much harm I had really caused.

It is too much to handle now. I believe killing myself is the only thing I could do right now to even make her feel slightly better. Even otherwise, there is no way I would be able to deal with this amount of guilt for the rest of my life. The past 6 months have been hard enough; the next ones are going to be tougher with this new piece of information. I am a terrible, terrible person, and the world is better off without people like me.

The only thing stopping me right now is my love for my parents, and I can't imagine what they would have to go through if I were to suicide. But I can already feel it, that the guilt emotion will very soon override the love, like it has done with every other emotion in me."

krayaken,5bhfu8,1478459721,Can't make it through the holidays alone,"I promised myself when I turn 30 and if I was still single I would just put myself out of my misery. I've turned 30 a few months ago and still single. Only been in one relationship 4 years ago that lasted 1 year but I wasn't really into her just stuck with it because nobody ever liked me before and I wanted to see what it was like. I have zero friends, have always been an introvert and never understood how to communicate. I'm always the outcast even at networking events people look at me like I don't speak english.

I was bullied through school and all through life people have just pushed me around and taken advantage of me. Even at work I output twice the work of my coworkers yet I'm paid literally half because they know how to stand up for themselves and I'm too scared to say anything and make the same pay as the interns despite 10 years experience. I even have an advanced degree but that got me nowhere. I have the nice-guy syndrome, and reality pains me every day to realize nice guys truly finish last. Not just with work but with relationships.

Girls avoid me like the plague. I think I'm good looking but somehow they just see something wrong with me. I've had 2 dates in the last 4 years and they ghosted immediately after the date. I see lots of ugly people holding hands and I just know I'm better looking and why can't I find something. I feel like I must be majorly deformed or something and just so used to it that I don't notice it when I look in the mirror.

The holidays are always super tough for me and I don't think I can make it through this year. Even if I found someone today, they wouldn't know me enough to want to spend the holiday with me.

I see so many people with true friends, childhood friends with deep connections. That's something I want but I'm way too old to ever get that. Even if I find a couple friends, they'll never bond to me like their childhood friends.

Mostly I just want a relationship. I'm 30 and look 20. So 20 year olds don't want me once they find out I'm really 30 and 30 year olds don't want me because I look 20. Also it seems everyone over 25 is already married or had been engaged or have children. I feel if I find someone on my same level they would have to be super undesirable. I feel all hope is lost in finding someone desirable for me. Plus if they were desirable then there are so many better guys with tons of money, friends, family. I have nothing to offer anyone.

I don't even enjoy any activities anymore. I used to enjoy a bunch of things but gave them all up. Like fishing and hiking but they were all solo activities and I'm tired of being isolated."
throwaway149822,5fdv50,1480363421,"Girlfriend considering suicide, need help convincing her otherwise. She cannot see this thread.","So, here's the long story short here. 

My girlfriend, let's call her Lilly, has a very, very hard home life. Her parents are split, both with a new partner. At her father's house, she is loved, she is an only child (she despises children), and both parents make sure she's happy. Not spoil, but she's got a good life.

At her mother's house, she has a neglectful mother who, as far as I can tell, keeps custody for the child support. Her mother's boyfriend, Tommy, has hit her, has made sexual remarks towards her (he has not touched her besides pinching her ass once and claiming ""it was a joke, calm down.""), and yells at her. She is forced to go to her mother every other week for a week, and hates every single minute. Atop that, there are two kids and three babies, as well as her, making it even worse on her. She gets no quiet time to do homework, her phone is taken away at 6 and then she is forced to sleep by 8, and neither adults make any attempt towards helping her in any aspect. She is late for at least 2 hours every day out of the week when at her mother's, because she cannot use her phone as an alarm and both adults are too irresponsible to even wake up on time with their own alarms to help. She cannot simply ""sleep sooner"" because despite making her sleep at 8, the parents are not remotely quiet or reserved enough for her to sleep until around 11.

It was recently announced to her by her mother that she is being forced to travel to another country for Christmas break to spend time with Tommy, a man she hates and is by no means related to him, for a time longer than she should be with her mother (a whole month, which also cuts into all the children's school time), and is not allowed her phone throughout the time. 

And she can't act like she doesn't enjoy where she is, or her mother will take her phone away for a month, not let her go to her father's throughout the month, and keep her from seeing friends.

Her mother's abused her emotionally her entire life. Once, 10 years ago, they were moving a lot for financial reasons and her mother was a bit on edge, so she yelled a bit more than normal. Lilly was scared, she wanted to go back to where she used to live, she wanted to be comfortable again. She says she slept for about 5 hours every night there, and she's pretty sure everyone else was the same way. No one was happy. Her mother has the audacity to blame all the stress on Lilly. She's made her a scapegoat for the rest of the family.

She's run away from home six times since I've met her. 

For the last couple days, she's been a little distant. I wasn't going to prod too much, she's very shy and reserved and I figured she trusted me enough to tell me if she was feeling bad. I finally made her tell me today, because it just wasn't like her to act this way, and she tells me she's wondering if it would hurt her mother more to write a suicide note directly to her, to let her know it's her fault, or if just simply doing it would have a bigger impact.

I'm terrified and my mind is far, far too much of an emotional cloud to handle this properly. I can hardly think at all. I need help, what do I tell her? "

Podkayne_Fries,5alump,1478035612,*trigger warning-sexual abuse* Not trying because I would fail,"""Everyone has their miserable sob story"", I have said so often it may as well be a Podkayne quote (except in my real, common name). 

Age two: parents divorce and Dad is awarded custody of the older brothers who are the only people who understand my speech, due to a weird/normal palate deformity. 

Three: Violently sodomized... my mother shows everyone what was done at the hospital and I am unable to tell her Not To. 

Three: Misdiagnosed with a hole in my heart and given therapy to prep me for dying. It's just a mitral valve prolapse with regurgitation. This is common. 

Eleven: Raped, impregnated and given chlamydia. 

Twelve: Chose to birth this child as he was half me, in spite of what my mother suggested (and she was correct as that was very, very hard on my already damaged body). 

I have incidents from then on, but as I said, we all have our sob stories. Fact is I got therapy. It helped me see how things were not my fault. I am thankful. A three year old child is *not* and cannot be seductive, nor can a toddler cause her parents to divorce. 

I am now older. I am an alcoholic. Wow... it's weird to actually say it, but I am. I drink to numb the pain of various incidents, such as my recent loss of our sweet kitty, Clarissa. She died in peace, even though most humans aren't allowed that dignity. I am and have always been one of those weirdos who feel animals are innocent and humans are not. My husband and I got her at age six weeks, and that runt was with us for 11 years. She was my first Valentine's Day gift to him, costing all of ten dollars (USD). We were poor, but not too poor to support a kitten. She was lovely, sweet, trusting, and in a weird way she was a mascot of our marriage, as we married after dating only three months! That *never* works out, right?! That would be why our ""friends"" had a betting pool which started at our wedding, with timeframes placed and money or goods promised. We outlasted them all, but our little kitten is gone. 

I got drunk, acted a fool, then tried to kill myself and my shame is so painful. There are no words to describe how much this shame hurts.

People may think this is typical grief over losing a cat. Pet grief is serious, but it's more than ""normal"" grief. This is really weird. 

Last night I tried to kill myself in a way that should have worked. I failed. Today I am hung over, as I am an alcoholic. I have what I call a ""shameover"" which means I wish I were dead because I acted so foolishly in front of so many people, and hate myself. If there were a red button on this keyboard that would cause me to die there would be no post. I know what death is and am not afraid. 

There is no red button."

Right now, I'm seriously considering mixing barbiturates with alcohol because I have both available. Pill suicides almost never work though. Logically I know it's a bad idea, but I'm so miserable right now that I want to do it on the off chance it works. Although if it doesn't work, I'll be in more pain than I am now. I don't know what to do because I've tried so many things to make living tolerable and none of them ever work long term. "

I'm pretty sure she thinks I'm going through normal teen issues because she doesn't care enough to find out how bad it really is. She turns a blind eye to it, I guess. She refuses to acknowledge any problem I have. She thinks I choose to be lazy. Maybe it is normal teen issues and I'm over dramatic I don't know. I don't even know why I'm posting here.

Everyday now. Everyday i imagine an new way to die. Jumping into the subway line, in front of a bus, cutting myself till i bleed out. Drinking something and never wake up. Every single day i think in a new way of dying. I just can't do it. I tried, and the result was an arm with the most ugly scars someone ever saw, and a tattoo  trying  to cover it. So i just longsleeve since then. And i just think in a way to do it quick and painless. But i dont have the power for that. Every path i choose, this thing is there waiting for me. Already tried doctors, and all that talking... I really tried. I really wanted to get this thing out of my head. But whenever something goes wrong, the voices are there. The fear is there. The pain is there to haunt my toughts. I dont know what is this. I just embrace it. I just swim in that darkness, searching for something to end my life and put a stone for everything. My relations are all shit. All of them. The few people next to me, just avoid to talk about ""life"" with me. Because they know if they ask me i just have two answers: yes and ok. I cant really tell them that im thinking about dying everyday now, in the past 3 years. No one ever understand this. Always thinking '' naaah, it just a phase or gets better"". This never get better. This just gets invisible. And everytime it surfaces, its the deathwish again. Im just tired. I cant accomplish nothing in this state, but i just keep going on. I dont even know if i have a reason to live anymore. Why do we have to stay alive if we dont enjoy life? For others? And what about myself? I wish i could sleep forever, you know. Or be in some kind of coma, i dont care. I just dont wanna face tomorrow and the shitstorm it brings. And i just hope people dont feel this way because theres no way to get out of this. Just dying"

Ive always seen myself as someone who people deserve better than.  I have made so many mistakes and now I have lost contact with him. The thought of him being better off without me is unbearable. I can't fucking live without him. They are diagnosed with the same illnesses as me and they are the only person who understands me 100%. 
This has just been the icing on the cake of things that have been making my life a living hell. I have been in extensive treatment for 8 months. I have been attending group therapy weekly and individual therapy. I should feel lucky but it hasn't made my life anymore worth living or helped me with any coping skills. I feel like if all this treatment hasn't helped then I have exhausted all options.I feel tired of fighting. This is the darkest my life has been and I see no light at the end of the tunnel. Every night has been unbearable and I'm exhausted.
I have bought the means to end my life. I have written them a letter. I need them to know how much i care about them. I keep trying to distract myself but the thought of them keeps returning.

Irelevant_Throwaway,5fgwl4,1480397328,"If we only live in fear of the alternative, no one is truly happy, are they?","One big rationale I see is that people live because ""they don't know what happens next"", as in they have no knowledge of the afterlife, which no one truly does. However, that would mean we aren't choosing life due to happiness, it is due to oblivion. Doesn't this mean no one is happy, just dealing with it since it seems 'the better route'? Some could argue that life isn't about happiness, but then why live it. There is a possibility of death being the simplest form of the word. Should you live to appease the needs of others? Sorry if you see this as selfish, but living only to satisfy others while you feel unhappy seems rigged, that can be debated though. 

So I ask again. If we only live in fear of the alternative, no one is truly happy, are they? "

ToWriteLoveOn,5emlvh,1479973250,I hear it's good to talk.,"I'm depressed and suffer from anxiety. I've been this way since childhood. I don't really believe I'll get better. Most basic and difficult  things stress me out. I often wish I were dead. I'm kind of suicidal, but not in the way that most people see it. I just think about it a lot. I just don't want to exist most of the time. Life isn't enjoyable and it frustrates me. I often imagine taking a run and being far away from my thoughts and people/places I've known. I'm not really sure why, I guess it's my minds way of escape. But it makes me feel wistful and impulsive.

 I feel bouts of thankfulness. I appreciate when something nice happens. But I don't really feel joy for any prolonged period. It's also really hard to feel loved even though I know it or feel if I actually love others. In general I'm very kind and know who I love, I just have a hard time with positive emotions. 

I saw a psychologist for about a year. I got help through some trauma. I feel better in the sense that I deal with much less intrusive memories. But, I don't feel any more positive or have a mind set that makes me want to live. 

I realize that medication could help; but not being able to afford it currently, I'm kind of just trotting on. Although, I'm not sure medications can help much. A lot of my mind set is learned and shaped over the course of most my life. I might have a natural imbalance but I fear that all my reactions are trained, rather than genetic inclinations. 

I'm becoming reclusive. My loving husband thinks it is healthy to talk it out. I agree but It's a hard battle. He gladly endures me, but realizes I'm closing in on myself. It's hard to talk to someone irl because it's awkward to listen to or creates panic that is unhelpful. And, to be frank, I'm not comfortable with sharing. But being on a throw away account will have to count for now. I don't think these things are answered or completely read through by many people. So it makes it easier to share knowing anyone who reads and or responds, did so because they wanted to. Making this feel less like Russian Roulette. "

Bringing myself to school is a struggle. Getting out of bed is a struggle. I've never had goals or motivation for myself, so why continue? Commiting suicide was the only thing i though about. Day and night. I wanted it to end.

Something is missing in me. Feeling normal and loved.
I've felt this way for a couple of years, and only since august and now - its gotten to its worser period. I started self-harm at 9. And i couldnt stop. But here i am now - 2 months clean of any cutting. The though of doing it again has popped into my head for probably any time i can remember.

None of this is your fault. You should know that. Its not any of your parenting skills or whatever. Its me
Its my fault im a lazy, peice of shit failure that nobody likes. Im pathetic. If i cant deal with my depressing, anxious, stupid mindset, then who else in my family will? Its simple. I fucking cant. My life is heading nowhere so why should i continue.

Now you may be thinking - why didnt you get help? Its simple. I couldnt. No-one would listen to a shitty kid who bitches about shit that isnt bad at all, and has terrible anger problems. Maybe if i stopped being a pussy and overthinking everything, while being so scared of the world, it wouldnt have come to this. Maybe if i was born normal. Which i wasnt.

I came all this way today, believeng i was ""ugly"", ""fat"", ""sad guy"", ""loser"", ""dickhead"", ""cunt"" and i still didnt do anything about this?
No-one can help me anyways. I'm a lost case. Lost and alone. In this dark peice of shit named earth.

This descision was legitimatley the hardest thing i've ever had to do in my life. All of this time i thought of the ones who said they cared about me. My loved ones. 
And this can not be emphasized enough - this is not anybodys fault. I did this. I chose to do this. I just wanted the pain to end. Some people are just not fit for life. And unfortunatley, one of them is me.

The love an support you guys have given me recentley is just amazing. And i must thank you for that. I wish there was a better way to erase my existance. Without you knowing. Without you seeing my bloody wrists. Without you there.
I couldnt have asked for better parents - you guys gave me so much oppourtunities and chances. To not give up on me.I must thank you for that.
I wish you my family and friends the best in life. I'm hoping one day you can accept me. I love you. Im sorry.

To max.
You are my best friend. And i can't thank you enough for doing that. You stuck around me if i was feeling angry or sad. You sticked with me through everything. This isnt your fault at all. Its mine
I like how friendly you were to me and everyone else - so i decided to do the same. You know that one time i asked you "" you feeling ok? If you need anyone to talk to, ill always be here""?. I was legitimatley worried about you then. I was pained to see you tired and sad. I broke my promise tonight.

To millie and ella
I loved you. I liked you. All of this shit.
You joked about me commitiinnfpg suicide that night. I kind of wondered if you were a good friend or not. But considering you started the jurrasic classmates shit - you are my frriend.

Thank you ella for sticking around with me, agreeing with what i say, not doing anything bad, doing the stuff that was asked, doing things that nobody would want to do. The whole class appreciates what you do.
Goodbye for the last time.

I literally lose the ability to breathe when I know nobody understands me. I will never meet anybody who understands. How am I expected to do so much when they don't understand? I just feel as if the world is better off without me, like I'm the weight on its shoulders. Then there's my family and so on and so forth who would miss me dearly. They have glued my feet to the existence of this mortal realm. I don't know what to feel or why. When I speak, I talk in an unheard language and when I can speak and people can hear what I'm saying I only end up digging my own grave. I The most amusing part of all of this is that anybody close to me could see this message and yet they still wouldn't see. Not that they'd care. I'm getting to the point where I see someone being genuinely happy and I smile. Then, it's tough to do knowing that I could never be so happy as they are in that moment. I just said I felt, yet I don't feel. I am digging my own grave as we speak. Oh well, didn't have the strength to live anyway. Oh, there's another contradiction.

They'd provide a secure illusion that they understood as I blindly walked closer and closer into the trap I created for myself. How will I be able to face myself tomorrow? Knowing I'm a monster. I do so many things wrong. I know they're wrong, people tell me they're wrong and yet. Yet I still follow through with these ridiculous things I do that hurt people. I won't be accepted. I'm the outlier of outliers. My teachers don't understand that if they want me to respect them then they have to respect me. They will never understand that I have the potential to be 20 times smarter than them because everyone else is above and beyond me, the scum of society. Why won't people treat me like a person?

I tie my noose  but I still think about what I'm doing tomorrow. I think about living and I remind myself of all the reasons I want to die. College was supposed to go well. No stress from my family. A chance to learn new things. Instead I gave up. I kept digging myself deeper. I'm going to fail every class I'm taking. I'm not stupid, I could be at the top of my classes most likely. But I'm lazy, I can barely motivate myself to eat or move. I do well for short periods of time, but I always end up fucking up and I know that will never change. I will do this to myself again and again. Death is the best solution. But that cold logic doesn't stop me from crying with fear when I put the noose around my neck. It's almost 4:00 am, one of my few chances for redemption in my best class is at 10 am. I will probably sleep through it. Maybe that guilt will be enough push myself over the edge."
BreakStuff_,5fist3,1480428346,What's the point?,"I've been thinking about suicide for about 10 years now. About 5 years ago it got serious when I unsuccesfully tried to kill myself twice. Ever since I've thought about it daily, when I go to bed it's my last thought and the first when I wake up. Sometimes I even dream about it. I don't know how I'm still making it from day to day. 
And what for? If I look back at ten years ago, I might've killed myself right then, I wouldn't have missed out on much. Living is such a nuisance, people are so fucking complicated, I'm just frustrated with everything and everyone and I don't see a point in going on. I could go on like this for another couple decades, but what for? 
My life's not ""boohoo, I'm so sad and everything is so unfair"" (no offense if your life is), it's fucking boring and annoying. I wish I could be sad instead of just bored out of my mind and pissed at everyone and everything. Money doesn't bring me joy, games don't bring me joy, fucking doesn't bring me joy, socializing brings me absolutely no joy, drugs do bring me some joy, but only for brief moments.. I don't want anything from life but for it to end. I have no dreams or aspirations, no ambition. I've slowly cut off all my friends and family because I just couldn't bear the insignificant everyday bullshit and gossip, it's become such a fucking nuisance to hang out with anyone, I feel more like killing myself after a night out than I do after a month of isolating myself. I wish I could enjoy company, I wish I could like someone, maybe even love someone, but in reality I just don't care if anybody lives or dies. I don't feel anything except boredom and annoyance. I've tried cutting myself years ago, to feel something, but I just ruined my fucking clothes in the process. I've been scared of so many things in the past, but now I don't give a shit about anything anymore. I provoke fights in hope of being beaten bloody and maybe feeling anything else but just physical pain. 
Why can I still not bring myself to fucking end it? True, I'd like to see how GoT ends before I die, but I don't even care about that too much anymore. The memory of it will probably be erased along with everything else when I die, so why prolong the suffering when it's inevitable anyway?

The problem here comes from bipolar, adhd, ocd and stress from turning 29 and not being able to fulfill what I was destined to do. I do not mind my job, but the week leading up to my bday 11/19 was horrific, existentially. I generally know what depressive issues do to me, I'm used to them and take precautions. But I have never felt, honestly, so scared at approaching a birthday in my life.


By now I was either supposed to be a full time artist, a college professor of English or art, or full time novelist or TV writer and director. These careers will make me happy, I have had experience in all of them to varying degrees. But never talented enough, or perhaps focused enough, or perhaps confident enough to figure out how to make them vocations.

The existential crisis is dire. My feelings range from low key sad to unfettered apathy to fever pitch suicidality.

I do not want to die. I just feel stuck.

Add in I have self body image issues and possible unresolved or admitted trans issues (ftm) and you have a recipe for emotional hell.

I don't really know what to do. The more praise I get at work the less happy I am because I feel like I am locked in here. Though the place is fucking awesome.

Is this a quarter life crisis??? Any advice? I'm not going to kill myself but I'm in something super heavy right now.

I've reached out and done everything I can at this point but honestly I don't know what to do now. Almost daily now I'm getting messages about suicidal ideation, feelings of worthlessness, numbness, anxiety, and fear. I have been in that position, so I can empathize. I want to drag them out of this hole because they're a really great person that I love so much and care for deeply. They have no access to proper health care or medication so they basically just talk to me and while I offered to be there, it weighs on my heart to feel like I'm their only outlet.

goingbygas,5euuub,1480096992,talking won't solve my problems,"Its been 5 years of depression and anxiety, each year getting progressively worse. This year I finally decided that enough is enough. I've talked about my problems extensively on the internet and with (multiple) suicide hotline operators. I came to the realisation months ago that talking about my problems will not help.

There is a huge emphasis on ""reaching out"" or ""talking"" however I've come very close to having the policed called on me multiple times because of how description I've been over the phone. I stopped calling years ago because of how useless they were (no offense). I imagine that years from then I would have conquered depression and anxiety and lived life to the fullest.

I was wrong. It won.

Past two years has been bad decision after bad decision and there has been no stopping the depressed, anxious and self-destruction part of my brain from completely fucking up my life. I honestly don't remember the last time I had a decent night of sleep. I decided months ago that I would through with a complicated method. I should've been dead months ago but a part of me always thought there was a way out. Last sunday I gained the courage to go out and purchase supplies.

Talking has never worked for me, and statistically it will not work for some of you that are actually suicidal. What you are actually doing is prolonging your suffering as I had for the last few months. My post may go against rule 1.b of the guidelines but I just feel as a last thought that some of you should consider whether you're actually prolonging your suffering or actually making an effort to get out of depression. Your brain is very good at deceiving you if you have a mental illness. Many times I thought I was making positive changes in my life.

Death for me will be an escape. I imagine myself slowly losing consciousness until I will reach a state where I will have no worries and will no longer be sad. "

TheCanerentREMedy,5e5r94,1479754452,"Struggling, feeling trapped, what should I do?","As long as I can remember I have had stomach pains. These pains were caused by anything I would intake except water. I'm in my twenties now and have gone to a plethora of doctors, physicians, dietitians. I've been to local hospitals and have even gone to the Mayo Clinic in search of relief with no resolve except a simple diagnosis of IBS or a Sensitive Digestive Tract. Through the earlier years I would find minor relief in natural supplements provided by my doctors, but a tolerance seemed to grow to the point that any supplement would disrupt me rather than create ease. 

I found myself in a very deep and dark place as a child and through my teen years up to now. The only bliss I could find was in the company of my friends with myself feeling like a burden or problem for my family. To some people's dismay, I found research through my friends that Cannabis can help with G.I. Pain. 

To that end I found myself searching for more answers from doctors while working with this crutch or the help from cannabis. I have now created a state of comfortable management for my stomach pain which helps provide Love of life again. Although, my family is DEAD SET on the idea that Cannabis is hurting the cause more than helping. Over the years it seems they have forgotten about my stomach issue because they have convinced themselves that cannabis is now causing the pain because ""My mind could be playing tricks on me"" in some sort of mental game, it's a stretch but they are desperately stubborn when it comes to their view of virtues and stance on cannabis. 

How can I convey that they are causing a portion of the disabilities and depression by there way of ideological suppression? 

How can I convey without sounding like a stoner' that the well-being of an individual who needs an inhaler would show signs of deterioration of morale if everyone were to criticize and tell them what they do/feel/think is wrong or most likely in their head. 

My family has helped me so much and they are currently helping support me so I can't very well say ""hey, fuck off this works for me"" and expect them to leave it alone. 

For Example: spending time usually involves eating which causes much worry for me being that I can't use Cannabis around them or anything remote. Even being medicated in their presence would infuriate them so when I don't put myself in that situation they only grow their stigma towards the medicine more and more.

It's hard enough worrying about these pains and the demoralizing aspect of this life I've been given. Now I feel like I'm in the ocean and the only hand reaching to save me is contemplating cutting ties for the better.

anothersociallyinept,5b0gvn,1478218458,"I'm not going to do it, but I also wish I could.","I just got suspended.  I may be getting fired tomorrow.

I'm looking at an alternative solution right now and wishing I could do it.  I have the method.  I just need the guts.

It doesn't help that there is a girl involved, and she verbally gives me signals that we're work friends (and nothing more, although I haven't asked), giving me big smiles, but then knowingly stabs me in the back.  And when I tried to avoid interacting with her more than minimally, she said we should talk, that I seemed down, making me think that no I'm not bothering her.  And then weeks later after I go back to normal (nothing more than chatting with her at the office), and her stopping by my office occasionally to say hi or ask for a soda, I find out she called me the creepy IT guy who keeps bothering her. (on her twitter page, so maybe I am creepy. ugh.  But it's not like I'm stalking her. I just happened to see her site that she made public, and months later after I'd been talking to her.)

So the suspension is because I copied one of her public tweets to the person who I thought she was talking about, and did it through an email account I created on a free mail server.  My mistake was including her name in the account name.  I felt bad about it last night and told her what I did, apologizing for it.  She claimed she'd known it was me, and I find out later she'd forwarded it to everyone.

If I hadn't come forward on my own, no one would have been able to prove it.   I had no idea it was all over the company, but the managers knew.  So either she told everyone she thought it was me when she forwarded it, or she told everyone after I apologized to her.

So now I'm either gonna be fired, or I get to go back and live with the stigma.  I guess this explains a few interactions I had yesterday.

Edit:
so I have a plan, but I doubt if I'll be able to follow through with it.  I actually went to the step of setting up a delayed email account, and wrote up emails to send in notepad so that I could make sure not to accidentally send them. (what's worse than killing yourself.  Accidentally emailing people that you're going to before you've really made the final decision.)  But then NOT saving the notepad files before my machine froze up.

So then I discover that the delayed email site has a limit of 2 emails unless I pay for the account.  But I had 4 letters,  ack.  So I should just pay for the account right?  But if I decide not to do it but I still get fired,  I won't need the account.  fuck.  

So then I was starting to feel a little better and maybe it will be ok.  But then I realize that I haven't been getting any emails from my job on my phone.  They changed my password.  Well, I get it.  Not encouraging though.  And now I'm feeling more discouraged than before though.

I'm not fired yet, but only because the bosses aren't in until Monday.

There's a certain amount of wanting to do it just so that everyone at work will know.  It's not like I'd have to face them again, right?  I guess I have a drama streak in me.)

I definitely don't want to attempt and fail though.  From what I read, if I take enough of my bp pills at once, I'll stop my heart.  I'm pretty sure there's an afterlife so I'm not worried about that.  I believe that when I die, I'll just be dead.  But that is a hard thing to do.

I really wish I could just prevent my own conception.  Or that I didn't survive various things in my youth.  Everyone around me would probably be better off.

But attempting and failing, that would be far worse.  I couldn't face anyone after that.

Edit 2:
I'm thinking I'm not gonna do it at home. I'm gonna kick off the delayed emails, drive to the hospital in the evening (they have a nice waiting area in a few spots), and take some pills.  I figure it won't be quite as horrible for some hospital employee to discover me than if I were to make a 911 responder do it at my home a day after.  Plus, this way my cat won't have to experience it.  Hopefully my sister will find a home for him though.  My other thought is to use a motel, but I don't want to mess up a poor clerk's day.  Although now that I'm thinking about it, that might be the way to go.  The hospital route might be chancy.  Someone might notice me too soon, and manage to make everything worse.  Waking up after a failed attempt, with the letters going out, would be very bad.

I gotta say, I don't know that I want to die. I just really don't want to live anymore.  Plus, the drama queen in me would be pleased.  I'm so fucked up.

I doubt if I'll go through with this but it's so hard to live with the consequences."

I do photography and modeling but none of it brings in enough money. So, its not depression. Shit just sucks. And its been sucking for a few years now. Things just keep getting worse. The election and the environmental destruction I keep seeing doesn't help either. I can't convince myself for more than 5 mins at a time that things will get better. I just don't believe that any more. I have this sort of philosophy to dieting. Only eat food if you're enjoying it. And on a lot of the forums it said the point to life was to enjoy it. But with food, if I don't enjoy it I stop eating it or I throw it away. Why shouldn't I just die and throw this life away if I'm not enjoying it. I don't really have friends.

lonelyheartbroken,5f2usa,1480210226,Falling to pieces,"Hello,
Long time lurker, but this is actually my first post on reddit and I have no clue where to begin. I don't know how much detail to go into, but I really need to talk to someone about this. I apologize in advance for my broken thoughts, some may not even matter but bear with me. Im a 27 year old female (fairly pretty, decently intelligent - NOT bragging, just what I'm told although I really can't see it most of the time) and I go in and out of very depressed suicidal moods, more often recently. I have struggled with depression and severe anxiety for as long as I can remember. Many medications later I have realized that weed is the only thing that works for me. I called a suicide hotline about 2 weeks ago (also a first for me) and have felt pretty good, until yesterday. I have been in a relationship with a man for close to 12 years now. We started dating when I was 16 and I was in a longer relationship with my ""first love"" before that. My current fiance (he proposed on my 18th birthday and then subsequently told me that he didn't want to get married) is bisexual, which I have known for a long time and I have allowed him to have relationships because he needs that in order to be happy. I went as far as to sleep on an air mattress for 6 months in another room while he was in a relationship with a guy who he didn't even tell that we were together (the guy was a foreign language student here for a semester). My fiancé and I own businesses and we have ever since we started dating, which seems to be a point of contention often. We recently had a business stolen by an investor and we are broke, trying to build the business back. We are both creative people, but he likes to throw as much work at me as possible and then get mad when I haven't completed it all. I have horrible anxiety about talking on the telephone (and email communications for that matter, I have a fear of talking to people and he puts me in charge of all customer communications) Several years ago I guess that the stress started getting to me, and my anxiety reached a peak. He started a new business and all I could find myself doing was watching netflix for hours on end because it was the only thing that relieved my anxiety. I was also struggling with the fact that every male mate that my fiancé has ever had always takes precedence over me, even if he doesn't realize that he's doing it. He had formed a relationship with his sous chef who was living in our home, and they were going out constantly blowing money leaving me at home to stress even more about our bills. The sous chef eventually stopped working all together and blamed anything he could on me. My fiancé still believes to this day that all of the issues caused were my fault. When the sous chef left, that was my fault too. My fiancé has never taken responsibility for any wrongdoings from day 1 and everything always ends up falling on me (which i cannot emotionally take anymore) He is also pretty emotionally abusive, of which I am aware. As soon as he is upset about something, which is pretty easy to accomplish, it is hours of him screaming at me about how worthless, stupid and embarrassing I am and how I ruin everything and i've ruined every relationship he's ever had. He's told me multiple times that i just need to get it over with and kill myself because its the only thing that ill ever be good at. Somewhere along the line I developed a habit of lying about things when he asks (always when were stuck in a car and I have no where to go) as to avoid conflict all together. This is my biggest flaw and I can't stand it. The last 2 months have been absolute hell. We have been in so many arguments that my heart can't take it any more. He will scream at me for an hour to leave and get out of his life, but when I take steps to leave he won't let me. I left and went to my parents house and he came and wouldn't leave. He's tearing my heart apart piece by piece and I don't know if I'm going to be able to put it back together at this point. If I leave he is also trying to hold our 2 dogs hostage, which are my world and I wouldn't know what to do without them (or him for that matter). I feel so stuck, lost and heartbroken. I feel lonely all the time, no matter who I'm with. Im constantly thinking about suicide as it feels like my only option at this point. Either I stay and spend the rest of my life unappreciated walking on eggshells and with my stomach tied in knots afraid that I might make him upset again. If I leave, I have to leave my dogs who are my absolute best friends and start over at almost 30 without nothing (no home, no car, no money, my entire work history would be with him and he is super vindictive so he wouldn't give me any references if I left) my only option would be to move in with my religious aunt and uncle and I am very much not religious (during the good times I like to consider myself a buddhist, but a true buddhist would never think of self harm) Or i can just end it all. The second that I start to feel happy and confident, my life turns upside down. I feel like I have this huge black cloud over my head and it won't go away. Ive always struggled with confidence and now that I finally feel like I'm growing into my own some, I feel completely stuck. This isn't even the half of it, and I don't know if I even covered enough for this to make sense. I know that suicide isn't the way out, but I really don't see many other options. I don't even know what this post will accomplish, maybe just the therapy of writing it out and knowing that someone will know will be of help, but I doubt it. I used to get some relief from watching tv or smoking weed and relaxing, but the tv shows don't seem to work anymore and he's currentlyupset with  me and his jump to method of torture recently has been taking away my smoking device and product so that I can't get high. Im so sick of feeling this way, I just want to be happy and lead a productive life. Someone help me, please just give me some direction or something (I know that I have to solve my own problems) I feel so lost.

Again, sorry for the horribly fragmented thoughts and any spelling or grammar mistakes."
JakeHaydes,5bdtym,1478401390,Life isn't worth living,"*This is a very personal post so if you don't care about listening to the whining of a kid, do yourself a favor and move on.*

This is just an unloading of some thoughts I've just been having recently. I can't talk to anyone about them. Maybe because I'm worried that they'll be too worried or because I'm worried that they'll agree, and at that point there's only one option left. I just need to get this out there, to say it as it comes to me.

Every time I wake up, I wonder why? Why should I get out of bed? If you knew me, you'd tell me that I need to because I have to go to college. But why do I want to? I feel like an outcast there, even though I'm most people's friend. I'm not smart enough to be there, there's so many people better than me at every one of my subjects. I feel embarrassed to even be in the same room as most of them, because they have to be thinking 'why is he here? He's nowhere as good as he thinks he is'. Most of the work I do feels pointless anyway. I mean let's face it, it's probably not gonna lead me anywhere. But more on that in a sec...
I suppose you could say hanging out with my friends is worth it but I spend maybe just over an hour a day with them at best, and even though we have fun I still feel empty. Probably because any sort of meaningful conversation is off limits and we only talk about humorous banalities. It's fun in the moment, but only in the moment. I'm not staying here just for that moment. Not to mention the fact that I'm none of their best friends. To me, that matters.

But ok, let's talk about after I complete my A-Levels. Best case scenario, I get what I need. What next? Well, more of the same really, just in a different setting. University. Now we're looking at even more work and even more loneliness. Likelihood is, if I don't make good friends quickly, I'll be going to lectures and going back to my dorm all day, every day. That sounds like no way to live. Plus, looking at the current state of things, getting a job is looking unlikely and if I get one, it's going to be horrible. I mean, say I do get a job. Then we're looking at the majority of my days being taken up by mind numbing and tedious tasks being completed day in, day out so that I can receive a fraction of the money I generate while my boss keeps threatening to fire me. Great. And even if I do stick with it long enough to rise up the ladder, I'm going to turn around in my middle age and realize it was all for nothing but a bit of money and a shiny car and I'm still as alone and depressed as I've always been. Even better. But that might not happen because I don't want any sort of corporate job. I want to be a writer... a group of people so depressed, alcoholic and suicidal that it's become a cliche. Chances are my ideas are way too derivative for my work to ever be anything but criticized and mocked, if ever noticed at all. So in terms of a career, the odds of my life being fulfilling are against me.

But what about love? Doesn't that make it worth it? Love has tried its best to steer clear of me. Every time I've fallen in love, without fail and no mater how reciprocal it's seemed, they rejected me. Probably with good reason. I'm not the most unattractive guy, but I can't be good to be around as I'm sure you can tell from this post. I get nervous, insecure and clingy. Great boyfriend material. Anyway, even if I could fall in love with a girl who loved me back, what next? We just carry on the relationship until one of us falls out of love or dies. Painful no matter what. I'll probably end up as one of those divorced forty year old's who still desperately tries to get into the dating scene but cries in his car outside clubs and eventually hangs himself in his studio apartment, leaving his remaining few grand to the kids who pity him anyway. But likelihood is, none of this will happen. Love is rare, probably too rare for an ordinary kid like me, and I'm likely to go my entire life without ever again feeling it. 

A greater good? Yeah right. Have you seen our current political landscape? Have you seen anything we've ever created? Our species' very touch is insidious. We're fucked, and our best chance of being saved is long gone. Human beings are animals, violent and selfish. As long as we hold onto those base urges, we'll never have an equal and functioning society. All we are are biological puppets with heads full of false imaginings. We were fucked from the get go. 

So you must be thinking 'Christ, you're clearly depressed. Go get help.' What help? Everyone I know who's on antidepressants is still fucked in some way or another. And it feels odd to turn to altering my chemical makeup and blocking out thoughts as the only way to be happy. It feels like I'm right, but I'm going to willfully ignore it. Or a shrink. Barely better than a priest. Someone to give me an illusion of hope, to tell me there's a light at the end of the tunnel offering nothing but sentiment and a professional smile. Then taking my money for it.

Right. That's all that comes to mind right now. I know, it's very bleak, but isn't that what this sub's for? Anyway, thanks to anyone who reads and responds.

Tldr: A career won't satisfy me, love keeps evading me, the human race is hopeless and I can't see a way out."
QuickThrowaway4Today,5exb6j,1480127842,Feeling worse than ever and guilty for it,"I am a 21 year old female and having suffered from severe OCD since 12 and depression since 15, I just feel so tired. I know people live their whole lives this way and that scares me, because I don't feel strong enough to cope anymore, and suicidal thoughts are getting more often, and less fleeting. I have moments where I truly consider it, but I'm terrified of it at the same time, and I feel sick at the thought of hurting my SO and family.

I am not getting any kind of therapy as I have previously had CBT and I just did not feel it helped at all, and I am not on anti depressants as my mother has always suffered from depression and having seen her reliance on medication growing up, it really scares me. If I go on medication, will it be a short term or long term solution, will I be able to come off it at some point or rely on it forever? I'm terrified of medication making things even worse because I'm struggling as it is. But then again, could things really even get any worse?

I feel guilty for feeling the way I do right now, and even thinking of suicide, because I have done this to myself by not getting therapy or medication sooner. I plan to go to the doctors on Monday morning and push for therapy, medication and I want to discuss the possibility of me having borderline personality disorder, but last time I tried to mention that to a doctor I was laughed at and not taken seriously. I feel like no one takes me seriously, including my fiance, if I try to calmly tell him I feel like hurting myself or have suicidal thoughts his response is to roll his eyes or get irritated with me - I know he thinks I just want attention. I think perhaps it is because I have struggled with self harm since I first dealt with depression at 15, although the past few years I rarely do it as I try so hard to cope, maybe he has became desensitised to me wanting to hurt myself. I honestly feel like I am dying inside, I don't have any friends to turn to, or anyone that understands. I can't cope with even the smallest of things anymore, one fight with my SO and I'm hitting myself in the head because I can't take the emotions, they're too much now, they're worse than ever. Sometimes I look so calm on the outside but inside I feel physical pain, I cannot express the pain I feel in my chest when I am so sad and I feel so alone in this.

I also feel guilty because of how my OCD and depression are affecting my relationship, I'm terrified of my fiancé leaving me because I'm not normal, and expecting him to deal with someone who has these problems is just not right and not fair. Although he has reassured me he wont, the fear of him leaving me is still there and making my depression even worse. I feel hopeless and helpless, like I am just waiting for the day he will leave because I am not worth loving, I am completely worthless. 

I am at university at the moment, and when I go to the doctors on Monday I am going to have to try to get a note to use as evidence for extensions for all of my assignments due in soon, as my life has just been put on hold because of how I am feeling. I have bills to pay and no job at the moment, and I can barely get myself together most days, how am I going to cope with a job, whilst trying to catch up on all of the university work I have been missing and do all of my assignments, I am just completely unravelling and I have no support system and I have no one to blame but myself.

I am sorry if this didn't make much sense, I struggle to even make sense of how I am feeling, it's so difficult to put into words.

TLDR; Suffering from OCD and Depression, feeling guilty, the guilt makes it worse, I feel I have no support."
cherryhardwood,5cc4e9,1478832027,Planning Harder,"Just sick at the prospect of continuing to live in dependency due to economic/psychiatric inability to earn enough to live independently. I have tried so long, working blue collar jobs, getting degree &amp; 2 diplomas &amp; pursuing a Masters degree, trying clerical/waitressing/pink collar jobs, etc. Now on pitiful disability pension, work casual for a pittance.

I have disappointed everyone who thought I was, or would turn out to be, something in life. Including myself. 

I have tried &amp; failed 3 x to commit suicide in the past. I just get in ER or maybe psych ward a few days. No one visits or helps me. 

When I care about others, I just get rejected because I am, &amp; I present as, psychiatrically disabled. I've tried so many groups, programs, medications.... I'm 45, this is getting real old. 

Thinking of a NYE jump onto subway tracks in a big city, because other things have not worked. I'm not even making ""a cry for help"", just motivating myself to follow through better this time. "

anyway, enough about me. does anyone have ideas of things to do that are meaningful or at least distracting? i'm supposed to have therapy but i'm not going to that in case my therapist figures me out (she's very smart). so really i have the whole day free. what to do, what to do...."

I'm almost at the point where the pain of death by hanging would be less than what I am suffering from right now
elevenfifteenpm,5c610q,1478753029,This is now the second time I've used a suicide hotline on my birthday,"Just turned 22, and it's the second time I poured my heart out on a text hotline. It's also the second time I'm using r/suicidewatch. If I can't find happiness even on my birthday, I know I shouldn't be alive.

It feels that there are much, much more people out there that see my life as invalid than people that find value in it. I shouldn't be striving to find some objective value to my life if very few people are going to acknowledge it anyways. I know people will say to just focus on the people that care for me, but I simply can't do that when I'm surrounded by people that will benefit more if I was gone. I'm simply not strong enough to not let these people get to me.

I have no plan for the future anymore. I graduate in April in a degree that involves a profession that I hate the more I study it. The only reason I'm completing it is because the degree is so prestigious, and I want to say that I earned it. Plus, better chances at getting rid of $30k of student debt if I had a college degree-required job.

I don't want to be a leech to my mom and her boyfriend while I try to figure out what the hell I'm even good for, especially when I don't see that happening. I hate it when they spend money on me now, so I'd especially feel guilty if they had to spend money on me if I didn't get a job right out of college in the profession I studied so hard for. I don't have the money or talent to start my own venture, and I won't even come close to it for a long time. I'm stuck here, aimless and with nowhere to go. 

I want to be better. My god, do I want to be better. Since being diagnosed with autism at the age of 3, I spend my whole life trying to catch up to where people my age were at, even though I could never truly succeed. But the fact that people will hate me no matter what, that I will never be good enough and that I have nowhere to go for the future makes me want to give up. I think that's what this world is pushing me to do.

Sorry for the rambling. I have a hard time keeping focus."
EndofDayz1,5ef7ed,1479872482,"This might be the end, we'll see","First off, sorry for the ambiguous title.

LONG, painful story short, my girlfriend of 3 years and I broke up very recently.

At this point, I have very little interest in living. It didn't come down to love, or resentment, or anything in that sense; I just lost the feeling we once had.

We'd been through a lot together, ups, downs, and everything inbetween. It just feels like it's time for us to move on, ya'know? We're young, and we shouldn't hold each other back.

I regret my decision, deeply, but the bridge has been burnt. 

This is less of a cry for help, and more of a goodbye honestly. I don't know where the wind will take me, whether it's death or more depression (as per the usual), or if I'll find happiness someday soon.

Maybe I'll wait until Thanksgiving has passed.

(Sorry for being all over the place, just fucked up from all of this right now.)"
CleverTreble,5bxszu,1478659173,I fucked up a lot,I've posted on here before. So a couple days ago I overdosed on Vicodin. It was not as hard to do as I thought it would be. I kept nodding off and waking up gasping for air. I still shake from it and generally feel tired all day. The back story is that I overreacted to a really fragile situation. My gf broke up with me so I insulted her and she turned a lot of my friends against me. I thought everybody would hate me because she was such an innocent and kind person. It was a culmination of a lot of things that through me over the edge though. My mom had disowned me about 3 months ago and I haven't seen my little sisters since then. I've lost a lot of my friends due to self-destructive behavior. I'm doing badly in school and most of my teachers dislike me. I know this is more of a prevention subreddit. I took 15 pills over the course of 4 hours and had been drunk. I woke up blue and extremely dizzy from the overdose. I'm still feeling the after effects of the acetaminophen on my liver but I'll pull through. The worst part is that I regret not taking them all at once and not dying instead of waking up sick.
farcrye,5ea20k,1479810584,Why can't something else kill me already?,"I've been severely depressed for all the time I can remember , anxious , struggled with OCD and had an eating disorder for several years. I'm on the other side of the world at the moment and I hate it. I didn't ask nor want to come here but I had very little choice. I would like to say I ""want"" to go back but I don't ""want"" anything anymore at all. Apart from to kill myself.

I feel like the stupidest fucking person out there. I'm so fucking sensitive. I tear up at the slightest thing, and everything makes me irritated in the day but I remain calm with other people. I get told by my psychologists that I don't make an effort to get better. I exercise everyday, I go outside everyday and it is very sunny here and I'm out for many hours. I have even been eating properly for the past few days but it's sending me absolutely crazy. Food makes me hate my body and myself even more. I didn't know it could be so hard to eat a silly piece of food but I always find myself getting upset about that too.

I feel like the world's worst person everyday but I never know what I have done wrong. I feel so isolated here. Even though I'm with my ""family"" i hate it. I'm usually very isolated but it's even worse here. I don't have any friends at my school back in my home country but I have people I talk to online and a boyfriend who lives a few hours away. 

But now I'm here, I just want to shut myself off more and more.  don't want to talk to anyone. I don't trust people at all. My Mother will shout at me everyday and I feel so fucking worthless. I can never be good in her books and met her standards which my sisters have met. She never wanted me in the first place and I hear it regularly about how she doesn't love me and wishes I wasn't here but no-one would want me and she doesn't want to get into trouble.

It really hurt in the past few months especially because I realized just how much my mother didn't like me. I thought she did. My father disowned me and I remember when I did see him , he was a strong alcoholic and drug user. He did inappropriate things too... I don't have any faith in anyone anymore.

When my relationship with my boyfriend started, it seemed like a good thing. He's very supportive even from far away. But now I just feel vile about it. it's eating me the way I'm feeling. I used to be holding on to life because of him but ... now I feel like I don't even love him. I still talk to him , and things continue as normal as if I don't feel this way. I'm just the worst person in the world because I find someone that loves me and I love them and I want to push them away completely. I don't want anyone or anything around me . I wish so much he didn't care for me because I want nothing more than to cut myself off from all of this ongoing shit. Because it just doesn't end. I don't want to hear any of the "" it'll get better ! give it time "" because it really does not. Things did get better for me ,  after moving schools to one where the bullying is way less sever and having  a boyfriend but yet I'm worse than ever.

I don't know what to do anymore in terms of expressing my feelings. I've had a psychologist and psychiatrist for a while now. When I talk about things they will only say about how they can't do much to help. I already know this myself though, I feel trapped myself. I'll usually mention things to my boyfriend too but since he is in a completely different timezone I'm not mentioning things and even before that it seemed like he always had work so I tried to stay quieter on how I was feeling. it just feels like when I talk about how I feel it doesn't change. My mother doesn't care and she's even told me about how she thinks all this is made up. I really wish it was , I wish I was like how she described saying I'm attention seeking. I really wish I did just want attention on myself and I didn't have all this stupid turmoil inside of me that I can't talk about as it doesn't get better but not talking about things doesn't make things better either.

It just feels like things drag on for ages when you talk about them. I just want to get over things but I don't get over anything. I'm trying with everything and school and it all just feels really flipping pointless. I want nothing more than to kill myself but I feel very much about how you're only passing your pain onto others. Which I don't want at all but I really don't want to live at all. I wish my boyfriend and his family didn't care so I could just kill myself.

It's more dangerous in my current location, in my home country I live in a rural environment but here it is the city near big seas. Big buildings. I'm so tempted. so so tempted.... because everyday is the same. I wake up and I hate myself. i wish I wasn't here. I wish I wasn't like this and I'll always be annoyed at the fact I'm like this in a modern world country with my boyfriend. my mother always tells me about how people are starving in other countries and I cry for no reason. But I'm just stupid and selfish and it doesn't help the way I think. nothing does and it just makes me more annoyed at myself. 

I wish something bad would happen to me and I'd just die. once and for all. no-one would need to know that I wished that I'd been able to die by killing myself. I'm too much of a coward to kill myself at this point. 

"
hulkinghurler,5fa8je,1480314957,Worried about being a bother,"In my main circle of friends, most of them know about my depression and suicidal tendencies. Some of them know I've self-harmed and survived one attempt before.

A few (I'd say no more than three) know that I do still seriously struggle with my various issues, and I talk to them semi-regularly when I feel I might be in a crisis or just need to blow off steam.

But recently I've been concerned that my reaching out to them might be a bit self-serving and manipulative. Though I never word it at all close to this, I fear it comes off as ""hey talk to me cause I wanna kill myself again!""

Anybody have similar struggles? Or advice as to how I can feel more comfortable returning to the same people repeatedly when I need some help?"
aaaaaaak7,5ey6za,1480141354,The future seems pointless right now,"It feels like everything I do just ends up being one big whopping failure. I applied for a job after months of begging my mom to let me get one, had a reference that worked there, and didn't get it. I dropped out of chemistry because I was failing the class. I was removed from participating in my schools science fair because I missed a meeting. My mom focusses all her attention and money on my sister even though they fight all the time. I can't afford to go to a decent college, don't qualify for scholarships, and the only one close by that I can maybe afford doesn't offer courses for what I want to go in to. I'm part of my schools theatre group, won two awards last year, auditioned for one of the main roles this year, and today I just found out that I've been put in the ensemble while a dude who screwed up his audition and was a dog in last years play got the part I had tried for. 

This all has mostly happened since the start of November. Suffice to say, it has been a very shitty month.

My mom doesn't give a shit about me. I told her I was transgender last year and she still won't acknowledge it. I told her I was suicidal last year and the most I got from her was ""talk to your school counsellor."" She blames me for things that aren't my fault, thinks the solution to every problem is yelling, and spends practically all the money she and her boyfriend earn on cigarettes and fast food. My dad is better but he's a lunatic who buys in to conspiracy theories and pyramid schemes and I'm 98% postivive he's mentally ill himself.

im ranting.

My point is things have been shitty for so long and lately all they've been doing is getting worse. My family fights, I can't really 'come out,' I hate my body, nothing I plan to do ever turns out right. Even if I could tell people I'm transgender, I wouldn't be able to afford hormones or surgery or anything like that.

wormbutter,5dzxt0,1479673595,I want to be normal or dead.,"I've always been depressed. I'm not exaggerating.

I can recall feeling apathetic and empty and sad and wanting to die even in my childhood; I'm talking like 5 years old, sitting there, praying to God to kill me.

I don't know who I am, I don't know what my personality is sans mental illness, I have no direction, and my family and friends think my mental illness IS my personality. I'm lost and empty and generally lacking of personhood.

When I was in high school I thought ""well when I graduate things will be better"" and ""when I grow up a little more things will get better"". I'm out of high school, I'm older, and things aren't better. And I'm beginning to realize this is going to be a lifelong condition that I'm going to have to fight everyday.

I'm tired and I don't want to fight anymore. I had so much potential and my mental illness and general shittiness has destroyed all of it. I'm physically, emotionally, and mentally exhausted. I'm a burden and a drain to the people I love.

I wish I had just been born ""normal"". And before anyone tries to tell me ""there's no such thing as normal uwu"", yes there is, there are benchmarks for behaviors, emotional states, and cognition that  are used to determine the relative psychological ""normality"" of an individual. And I wish I met those benchmarks. I wish I didn't ache everyday. I wish I could feel happiness or joy for just a few fleeting moments. I wish I was emotionally stable. I wish I didn't alienate everyone around me to the point of abandonment.

This isn't something that can go away entirely or can go into remission, I'm going to have to deal with the same fucking shit until I die, even with meds and therapy. I don't even want to get better anymore. I just want to have a quiet, warm death.

Too bad I don't have the balls to end my pathetic life. I'm just going to continue being a burden and destroying relationships and fucking myself over for as long as I live."
MsArya,5cwsgb,1479140773,Just at the end of my rope with all this shit,"My life has just been shitty for years and I just can't handle much more of it.  To start with, I'm trans and have been transitioning for a little over 2 years.  I still don't pass, and the fact that I don't come close to passing at this point means that I probably never will. And since I am trans, and like women, that brings up a whole host of issues that makes me feel like I'll just be alone forever.  To be blunt, even if I did pass, I don't think its fair to expect a lesbian to be okay with a dick in the room.  I mean hell, I'm not okay with a dick in the room INCLUDING my own.  Which makes me pretty afraid to get close to people, since if things did escalate, I wouldn't be able to have sex in any comfortable way.
On top of that, my family is not supportive of it in any way and the few friends that were accepting have all moved away.

I've been unemployed for 2 years, had to drop out of college about 4 months ago too.  My job history is a mess.  I've had 4 jobs in my life.  One looks good but was at a Burger King.  Fired from a Pizza Hut for being trans, and had to quit the other 2 a few weeks in due to some personal stuff coming up at the same time and not being allowed to miss a single day so early in their training programs.  So I pretty much only have an Associate's of Computer Science and a job at Burger King 6 years ago to my name.  I'm 24, and not a single job will call me back because of this.  Since its been so long I only have about $60 to my name so I can't even move to a town with better job prospects.

I've even been sexually assaulted in the past year.  And now with the Trump election I'm worried that the people who did these things to me will just feel emboldened to do it again or to even do something worse.

If it was just one of these things, I could probably work past it, but I've been dealing with garbage like this my whole life and I'm just so sick of it all.  But, when I made a post about buying a gun a bunch of people kept trying to make an effort to talk me out of it.  And while I still absolutely plan to shoot myself in a month or so when I can actually afford the gun, I figured it couldn't hurt to ask for some advice before I do.  I mean I'm unemployed and not in college, so I have plenty of time to listen to what people have to say.

capacop,5cyuqd,1479162345,Having a hard time coping with the suicide of my girlfriend,"My girlfriend commited suicide at the end of June. One evening, after a day we spent just hanging out in her room, she said she was going to go take a bath. I thought nothing of it as she'd been acting quite normal and cheerful throughout most of the day (she'd been acting depressed in the weeks leading up to her suicide due to a falling out with her family and the suicide of her close friend a few months prior). I drifted off to sleep when she went upstairs, only to wake up 3 hours later with her not there. I went upstairs to check on her and could hear the bath still running. There was no response after I knocked on the door and called her name. I kicked the bathroom door down to find her in her underwear, wearing make-up, completely submerged in the bath, with a book with residue of some unknown powder, an empty baggy and straw on it. I called an ambulance, attempted CPR, but the paramedics said she'd been dead a few hours after they had arrives and there was nothing that could be done.

While over the summer, I managed to cope fairly well by keeping busy through spending a lot of time with people close to me, I am currently suffering from soul-crushing loneliness and depression. I know I'm not alone in this, as I have very close friends I can turn to for support, but there are days where I feel totally hopeless and isolated and talking to people and doing simple tasks feel like the hardest things in the world. I don't think I've ever had such a connection with someone in my entire life and now it feels like a part of me is gone now that's she's gone. I think about her and her suicide every single day and I know I'm never going to be the same person again. I feel like I have a void inside of me that no matter what I do, will never go away. I've accepted the fact that she's gone, and that there was nothing anything anyone could have done to stop her from taking her own life, but it's something I can't not think about. What pains me the most was that I had no idea of the extent of the pain she was going through, and although I tried to get her to open up a couple of times, I know I could have tried harder. She left no note, or any sort of goodbye, so I will never understand what she was truly going through. All I want to do is hug her and tell her everything is going to be OK. 

I started a masters degree this year hoping that it would help keep me busy and keep my mind off things, but it seems to have had an opposite effect and now I worry I'm not actually well enough mentally to go through with it, and that it's all going to be a waste of time and money. While I'm attending the majority of my classes and lectures, I'm experiencing zero motivation to carry out independent study and completing assignments.

There are many mornings where I wake up, and all I want to do is go back to sleep again in order to escape reality, sometimes hoping I'd never wake up. I occasionally have suicidal thoughts but I know that I'll never act on them as I can never do such a thing to the people that care about me. I'm just at a complete loss of what to do and I don't think I'll ever get better.

I'm not sure what I hope to gain out of this post but I feel I just needed to get this off my chest."

OK so I am now 22 and the problem with me is that I have absolutely no reason to be depressed. I have two successful parents who have given everything I need; a good education, a nice home and best of all they've taken me to places most people would be lucky to go to.

I've hiked Kilimanjaro, I've been skydiving, Bungee jumped off the highest commercial bungee jump in the world, swam on the edge of Victoria falls, ridden elephants, petted cheetahs and plenty more. I also have great friends from my school days who I am still somewhat in touch with.

Everything went wrong when I graduated high school and started University. Suddenly I knew no one in classes 200 people strong, I was living completely alone for the first time ever and I couldn't handle the responsibility. I know that pretty much everyone experiences this leaving of the comfort zone, but, pathetically, I couldn't handle it. It didn't take long for me to start missing lectures and then entire days, instead staying in where I knew no one could see me and playing games all day, always saying, I'll go in tomorrow and I'll make it up, no matter how hard it is I'll make it up.

Days became weeks and I knew that I fucked up, I couldn't possibly make it up anymore. I lied to everyone, my best friend, my parents, my brother. This is the first time I'm telling anyone the whole truth.

Eventually when exams came around I was caught in my lies and but instead of telling the truth I lied again. I said I had tried my hardest but the course was just too hard and I really wasn't enjoying it. My family, who paid my university fees, believed me and allowed me to change my course, though I would have to start from the beginning again next year, meaning I had half a year to find a job, a simple job so that my parents knew I wasn't wasting my time. I never got one, just played more and more games.

When I started my second course which my family was again paying for, I really did want to try and succeed, and I still believe that if I really tried I could've done really well. But then I started smoking weed, and I fell into the ""tomorrow I''l make it up"" trap again. Only this time when I knew it was too late I became more careful with my lies. 2 entire years later and my everyone I know believes I'm doing really well at Uni, I haven't attended a lecture in 1 and a half years.

And now after telling everyone how I've just finished my second year in my degree, the lies I've told are starting to fall apart again. My mum has been trying very hard to get me a job for the work experience required for my degree that I've lied about. She'd find me companies and I'd tell her I'd email and call them, but I never did.

But then she had one of her friends ask her boss to see if I could be accommodated at their company and they said yes. So now I have to go to a job to whom I've lied about my accomplishments and I just can't do it.

I know that my deception will soon be discovered and I don't want to be around when it is. That is how much of a selfish coward I am,  I'd rather kill myself and traumatise my family and friends than face them when they learn what a piece of shit I am. Which is why I don't think I'm actually depressed, just ashamed.

The worst thing about everything is that i know that even if by some miracle I was forgiven I would just do the same thing again and again. And I think in the long run my constant lying would hurt the people I love more than my suicide.

To be honest, the reason I'm writing all this now is because I just want people to know the truth before I try it, and maybe for people to agree with me in what I'm doing."
Victim-of-injustice,5egtq5,1479900431,Tomorrow I will die.,"This afternoon I received a phone call from police to say that my ex is going to get away with multiple accounts of sexual abuse and rape against me. I cannot live in this world anymore. I'm scared to go out, I'm scared to get close to anyone, I'm just scared. So tomorrow I will jump into the abyss of nothing because that has to be better than this."
deppresedthrowaway,5fcfd9,1480349118,"I'm just gonna start writing and update this every day, let's see how many days i have in me","So to start with I'll give some backstory, not too much because I'll probably do that another day, I'm in high school and I have 0 friends. Litteraly 0, I get to school and speak to no one. There was a period of about a week where I hadn't spoken to a single person, no not even my parents as they work at night so I stay home alone some days. I used to be one of those cringey people that thought ""I'm an introvert but I'm smart"" or something, now I notice I'm just really fucking stupid and no one actually cares about me. I did have friends before, they did come to this school, but we don't share classes and they have their own groups, I'm nothing like I was last year, I used to be funny energetic, things like that. I just don't have it in me anymore, I'm not failing any classes but the only reason for that is because I cheat in all my classes. I'm writing this at lunch, sitting alone, ready to cry but there's people near me. I can't sleep anymore and make it up during my electives, I used to go to sleep with asmr but that doesn't do anything for me now, when I lay in bed my legs and hands twitch because I know I won't sleep. Trying to sleep is the worst feeling of all, looking up and just seeing pitch black having to think of the day or life you have. I did have one friend earlier in the year but it seems that the election made her insane, asked me who I supported and then went on for 30 minutes texting me that if I don't support her candidate than the world will end or something, really I don't support anyone, I don't actually care about who's my president, not like itll change my sadness. I don't know what else to write here but I'll probably remember overnight, tommorow at approximately the same time I'll update this or make a new post or something of the sort"
justarandomnumber,5folqo,1480495483,nothing special here,"Hello there. I'm very honest with the title of this post, don't expect a really bad story or something like that. I'm sitting here before school is starting and my thoughts circle around how everything is shit. But in fact, nothing in my life is bad at all, i think. I'm not the guy who talks much, so I just give some facts:

-male/19
-in A-Levels, good student, but no plans for future
-friendly, but overprotective parents
-quite anxious, especially in moments like that
-I'm friendly, kind, polite and tried to help others, but I think that isn't my real personality
-you can laugh with me, you can talk with me
-there a some nice people in school, but I think there are no real friends in my life, no deeper connections
-I'm very bad in keeping connections up
-so I'm very lonely, since weeks I wasn't outside with people in my free time
-still virgin, never had a girlfriend
-my brain is shit, I always think of the bad sides of life, because the situation of many other people is worse than mine
-in fact I should be happy, but i don't know how, I can't
-already tried to take my life last year, but couldn't do the last and important cut
-I had some hours with a doc, but it doesn't really help
-I have problems with some words like ""normal, bad, good, morally, insanity"", just with the definition
-no hobbies, nothing that makes me happy
-in the last days the desire to die was very strong
-I'm bad in taking advise from others, so it is paradoxical I'm writing here
-my sight on life ist very sad, my brain can't believe in god, there is no reason why I'm here or why bad things happen

I'm not able to write all of my thoughts, I'm kinda exhausted. I really dont know whether I should kill myself or not, but it is a nice tought. I feel like I'm a waste of food and water, like there is no place for some people in this world, like me. I already dont know why I'm writing here, I mean there isnt one fact to think of suicide, but I do, all day. I think there are only two options, to kill myself or to change my entire life, which sounds cliched.

Why do you guys help people here? Because you like them, because you don't like suicide? Both is complety all right. There are a lot of people who doesn't write about there toughts, and they go without a sound, and nobody knows. Something like that is why I'm sad at all."

Meditation, religion (buddhism), meds (a lot of them), therapy, eating healthier, sleeping better, practicing sports... But none of them seem to work. My friends, parents and girlfriend all try to support me the way they can, but I can only feel they don't understand me. I feel so alone, so hopeless.

I just want to give up. Let it all go away. I can't study anymore because my mind is a mess right now. I don't feel I can connect to people anymore. Everything makes me so angry and so sad.

I just want to write a note to all of my friends and family and kill myself. Everything right now is pushing me into it. I just don't know what to do

NothingMuchRly,5bu62a,1478622176,"If I fail my business calculus test on Thursday, I'm going to end it all.","I know the title sounds petty and all but the thing is I shifted from a social science course where my grades were sky high. Ever since I shifted into this new course my life had been going downhill. I already failed an accountancy class and it looks as if I'm failing this calculus class as well. My parents say I don't study enough and I'm just wasting their money but I study every ducking day. The thing is I wouldn't be able to shift out to any other good course after this semester because calculus would probably fuck my GPA up to below 2.5. Failing this test on Thursday would mean me failing the entire class. 

I've been struggling with diagnosed severe depression and anxiety ever since I stepped into college. I've lost all my friends and I forgot how to make any new ones. I drove my girlfriend of 3 years away. I've started to drink and smoke heavily. I dunno guys, I feel like I've already gone past the point of no return because I just don't see how things can possibly get better. I have lots of acquaintances but barely any real friends. I have a shitty, non-supportive and narcissistic family and I'm just so tired. I JUST WANT TO FEEL SOME COMFORT BEFORE I GO. I CANT FUCKING TAKE THIS ANYMORE. "
soulless_cr,5biyd1,1478476472,Being fucked up from an early age makes it near impossible to not have a host of mental issues later in life,"The worst parts of my life are over, but it's impossible to escape the mental scars that will define the rest of your life. 

You grow up being constantly bullied and abused, and you will always have a distrust of people. You will always prefer to be alone and hate company. 

I find no meaning in other people. Given my current existence, I may never find somebody. I don't blame others', I blame myself. 

Apathy has always been my way of coping. I am as apathetic as the next psycho. I can show zero signs of emotion, like I don't have an ounce of gray matter left. 

Except that's a risky path, and I am careful to never be seen that way in public. In public I try my best to be a presentable or at least a normal human being. That's all everybody has known of me. Maybe family sees me a bit differently, but they all just sugar coat it. 

I am strong, but I see no use in being strong. Because all that is left is a shell of my former existence, and I die, sad, apathetic, yet invulnerable. "
HeteroscedasticXo,5dolyh,1479500495,I've thought about it for 13 years.,"I've thought about suicide for 13 years now. I've assessed the pros and cons. I've assessed the consequences of suicide. I've tried to improve my life during this time. I have come to the conclusion that death is what is best for me. I'm tired of being ugly, lonely, having no future, having no real friends, school, and so on. My life has truly sucked regardless of clinical depression. I've finally decided that suicide is the right thing for me and I'm happy about that. Now I can start planning when and how. I'll finally get to leave forever. "
NyaTestamentet,5e5spl,1479754877,I don't even know how I would ask for help at this point.,"I have moments where I desperately want someone to just know what's going on, someone who can help. But it's like it's gotten so far past the point where help is an option. I've walked in and out of so many emergency clinics, pussying out before my number is called. Every time I'm on the phone with my sister I'm constantly on the verge of saying something, when she asks how my depression is going it's like the words are right there in the back of my throat, but I have no idea what I would even say.

There are moments where I want someone to pull me out of the water, but I don't know how to wave so they can see me. "

I've told my parents about my depression and suicidality already and they have been doing a lot to try and help me, but I can't even help myself. I'm just sick of hating myself so much all the time.

jockesaurus,5dcb53,1479336604,To die with honour would be preferable. (only read if you got spare time),"Hmm i have for a long time battled between crippling depression and my own ideological determination, basically i find my life futile and without a greater goal. Most of my life i have just wanted one thing to make it into the history books, not because of some egoistical reason but because i read at a young age that a person could die twice, once when they stopped breathing and once when their name was said for the last time and that really got to me. However i have now lived for quite a while and it has not been a bad life. I've worked as an actor for quite a while and i'm currently studying to become a teacher in history and political science. I have friends and a somewhat functional family in that they care for me but we have always been estranged from each other. This life however in good and bad has always been mediocre and its tearing me apart. I feel useless, that in the end my life would amount to nothing and recently most of my thoughts have been on isolation to crawl under some rock and dissapear. 

Now i have always had a strong belief that only weak people would cause themselves ""self harm"" or commit suicide and in my own thoughts on humanity i have found that only a strong person can be successful in life and strong people don't cry, whine and bitch about life being hard or set against them. I have come to the realization that perhaps i'm not so strong and that i never will be more than mediocre. But i sure as hell try to be strong and never waiver in the face of a challenge but i feel like i am being driven mad. No matter how hard i try to keep all the bad memories in check, all negative emotions in balance or all my bad deeds forgotten i get beaten down by it. Lately every time i have had to leave my apartment it feels life a punch in the chest and the more i reflect upon a solution to this mental pain the worse it gets. I will not kill myself but if i would get in a car crash or if i would get the honor to die in combat or if i would get some serious disease it would please me greatly. Because in that way i would not have to die as a weakling in the eyes of others.

Now these are my thoughts you don't have to reply if you're not in the mood since other people may need your help more than me but if you wish to advice me on my thoughts don't pity me as that is the least i am after right now. If you have any tips regarding where my sacrifice could be used for a greater good i would gladly listen to them.

On a side note regarding my fixation on combat and honor it is my belief that some men where born to fight. That some individuals crave battle naturally. I have fought plenty of times against people who threatened me and i have also won several medals competing in the martial arts. I would say that the only time i actually feel total happiness is in a fight, when the adrenaline is pumping and the only thought in your mind is on eliminating youre foe. And if i had to chose a way to die this would be it.

I think i have gotten on long enough.

I'm tired of knowing that no matter what I do I'll never feel any lasting fulfillment or joy. How does an exception to life know that they are one when there is so much encouragement and support here? That wasn't how my life could be saved.

suicidedeathok,5fsten,1480546315,Paranoia is really fucked up,"I feel like the small college is going to go onto my internet history and read this. I keep thinking many of my professors are talking about me, and going past social convention to stage this 'intervention' to get me to a mental hospital. I can't stop thinking about it. I have no privacy here, everyone thinks I'm a depressed maniac and its EXTREMELY INVASIVE. I keep wanting to transfer but my parents make it difficult. My father keeps saying 'everyone except for me and your mother are out to get you, have no interest in you unless you can benefit them'. He had a hard life, very cynical. Everything will blow up if I go to a mental hospital again, the last one was fucked. I thought I would never get out because my personality is inherent, was going to hang myself in the bathroom. Luckily my father bailed me out. I'm so disconnected and anxious, completely out of society. I don't know what to do. I have no idea what I want to do with my life, everything was about appeasing my parents. I can't go against them and leave and do what I want. I would have to cut COMPLETE contact, and we are tight-knit, everyones neurotic, they will hunt me down again. I just want to be alone. I feel like I can't talk to anyone, my self-esteem doesn't exist anymore because I've become paralyzed in ALL ASPECTS OF LIFE for about two years. Two years of living death. One of my professors I think suspects my distrust of everyone around me, since we were talking about a paranoid character and I moved in a way that caught her eye contact. 

There's this guy who has shown interest in me, I keep trying to get up courage to talk to him again, I'm doing that tomorrow. But I saw him walking with another girl today. I need to clear up the 'paranoia' shit and try to lie my way out to this really intelligent professor. I hate burdening everyone. I hate being alive. I don't have any plans to die, but I hate being alive. There's no point if you're frozen up, so anxious, no self-worth, parents terrified of you and the world and will hunt you down. I just want to isolate myself and die. The future is a black wall. I don't know what to do. I need to transfer because I'm scared of everyone here because the campus is so small they know I've isolated myself for two years. After a certain point, if someones' empathy doesn't extend deep enough, they write you off as a maniac and outcast you. This entire place has outcasted me. I feel really scared, have nothing in my life that I like. I keep having imagined conversations with people I know and could be friends with, but I never act on it and talk to them irl, so everything has become jaded and floating around and it's like I'm slowly losing my mind in solitary confinement prison. I've been to so many therapists and taken pills. I just want to never speak to my parents, start over with nothing, ignore their free college tuition offer, but I'm too scared of their reaction. And I'm lazy, scared of the world too. You're either inside society and functional, or mentally ill and a piece of shit. I feel homeless and genuinely mentally ill, like it will never, ever get better. I'll just fall into drugs and die. Like fatalism. And death is god, so I can avoid everything else that's ambiguous. I've never had a real friend before, no trust, just fear. So sick of this shit. "

gbffnxg,5dcxe3,1479343800,What should I say to him?,"

Ever since I met him, he always wanted to be a father. He had the names for his kids picked up ever since he was 10. He always said, when I'm a dad this, when I'm a dad that. When we got married he immediately started planning how would he manage to become a dad.

Being two guys made that difficult. But we looked at all the options. We saved every penny. Finally we found a surrogate option that was under our budget. But there was a problem.

Turns out, he's infertile.

From the moment we got the result, he stopped speaking. He just silently cried. I tried my best to confort him, to being there for him, but he simply kept on crying. He didn't get up for work. I left to buy him his favourite coffee to try and cheer him up.

When I came back, I found him hanging from a noose. I took him down and called for an ambulance. He hasn't woken up yet.

On the hospital they asked me if he had left a note. That maybe that could help me understand. I went back and found it. It just said, DNR.

He hasn't woken up yet. What can I say? What can I do? This is so uncharacteristic for him. He's not even the depressive type. I don't know what I should do. I'm desperate. That's why I'm asking strangers on the Internet for advice.

disassociation (mostly this, can't connect to anyone, feel like i'm in a haze)

anxiety (huge levels/almost panicking)

gender identity issues (hate being female)

depression

spirituality issues (struggling with religion)

trust issues

men issues (been rejected/hurt/touched.... so there's hate there)

sexuality issues (bi? hate when ppl are crude/too vulgar)

always fatigued/low energy

can't focus (had ADHD growing up)

allergic to corn/wheat so i cant eat many tasty foods 

skin reactions/acne/hives from said allergies :(

jealous/hateful/angry a lot

sensitive (pained by the injustice of the world)

socially awkward

heart issues (arrhythmia/low heart rate)

breathing issues (connected to heart?)


I'm in good shape and eat pretty healthy (don't have much of a choice). I'm paying off my student loans and get decent work done although it's a growing struggle to focus. I just miss having happy memories. I haven't felt truly happy and present in the moment since I was 10.... except one moment. I took a ""smart pill"" and drank an energy drink, had a terrible reaction, almost died, woke up the next morning and felt like I was in total bliss. It's like something went off in my brain, I was focused, I was fully there, the light was shining in. I was so happy for a few minutes. 

And that was it. I don't have much will to live."

Obese. Binge eating disorder. Male
 25 soon 26.

Had a gf who introduced me to weed. Not blaming her. I accomplished a bachelor's and masters at my parent's expense. Im not from a poor family so i dont get to feel depressed according to ""friends"". Pretty sure i have autism or Asburgers. Can't maintain relationships. Constsntly fantasizing about a future i will never have. I thought i would have myself figured out by now. I'm a fucking mess and no1 really wants to be around me since my depression is a huge elephant in the room and wet blanket.


No I'm not smart. Everyone thinks i am because i graduated from university twice. Im not. I barely scraped by and lost my job after graduation. They told me to find a new profession. After 7 years of schooling for thay job. They were right to be honest. I hated it. I felt lost 24/7. Worried i have autism or ADD or something because i can not solve problems (aka. The key requirement to getting any professional job). All im good at is following rules. I cannot follow rules i create for myself. I think i have a learning disability. I wasn't hinest throughoutgrafuate school. I meeded a lot of help. I barely passed.

Unemplyed for 2 years straight. Gained weight. Binge eating has gotten much worse. Picked up a drug habit to boot from my ex. She finally had to dump me which i dont blame. Now that i dont have access to drugs i am trying out good old.fashioned legal alchohol.



I fear i will never amount to anything. I fear that mt learning disability (or believe in it) will prevent me from ever being a self sufficient adult.


Afraid i will never feel love. My health just keeps on getting worse and worse. I dont see a light at the end anymore.


Dont know what to do. Im sorry"

momoneymomorrison,5bel50,1478414152,"Not really contemplating suicide at the moment, but my deepest darkest memory makes me want to...","So, back in my freshman year of high school, there was this one kid and his friend who tried to bully everyone they possibly could. And these were kids that almost EVERYBODY hated (students mainly, but probably teachers too). But the memory I'm referring to occurred on valentine's day. 

I wanted to ask out the prettiest girl in my class to our annual valentine's dance (She was actually pretty reserved and kept to herself, but was extremely nice, which is why I liked her so much). So I muster the courage and ask her, but she kindly declines (She was going with her bf from another school). I was a little upset, but eventually got over it. But the bullies just wouldn't let it go.

Day-after-day I received insults from them since they saw me get rejected, but I ignored them. But one day, something inside me snapped. Because the main bully said insulting remarks about my sister who's disabled and the various sexual acts he'd perform on her. Now, I was in no way an athlete (Roughly 170 lbs). But the way I fought him made it seem otherwise.

I charged him and pushed him into a locker, where he hit his head first. He then fell with me on top of him. I then unleashed a barrage of hits all across his face. And not just quick little jabs, full-forced punches using all the strength I could muster. The second bully, meanwhile, ran to go tell teachers. I kept up this attack for what felt like forever. I even shoved one of my teachers onto the ground who tried to pull me off of him, before school security eventually got to me. I even fought like a wild animal to try and break free to keep hitting him. After all this, he landed in the hospital with a concussion and an unrecognizable face.

Just remembering his horrible, disfigured appearance after what I did is enough to make me shutter...

Oh, and by the way, I didn't even leave my room for almost two days...for anything. Nothing to eat, drink, whatever. I just sat there in silence, staring at my wall. And seeing my dad's face when he came to pick me up from school that same day...it was a look of both disappointment and disbelief. He also didn't even say anything to me."

Regal_Elkstone,5briw7,1478583642,Alienation Seeping In to Every Aspect of Life,"Elk P3: It's everywhere

I had some interesting conversations that just ended up with me getting shit on by people for being upset when other people mention relationship stuff. And how apparently, that entire interaction is my fault and fuck me for doing that. Which is a reasonable problem for me as the alternative is people mention that kind of thing and I spiral very quickly into self harm and other coping methods for horrifying thoughts circling round and around in my head

So that being said, I've reached a whole new level of done. As in done done. As in I have nowhere else to go, done. So keeping what happens when something brings up relationships in mind, let's have a look at why I have nowhere to go.

Now, I have a couple of things I tend to go to to escape the depressing harrowing lack of a life I have, or sometimes to try and escape the inner head death spiralling. Such things include:

- Video Gaming

- Youtube Videos

- Family workplace ish board gaming

- Talking with the only person that I ever hang out with online (I don't know anyone in person)

- Browsing support forums looking for ways of fixing this ridiculous situation

... Now, if I were to ask you to guess which of these activities I can now no longer do without hearing about couples stuff that makes me want to die, and turns the day into a head death spiral rolling on the floor for the entire day, then would you go for ""None of them, life is pretty great"", ""A couple but it's ok because you don't need to do everything in life"", or ""Every single one of them because people can't shut the fuck up about it for 5 seconds""?

If you answered ""Every single one of them because people can't shut the fuck up about it for 5 seconds"" then you are in an apparrent minority that don't want to talk about it every 5 seconds, so... that's a small comfort. But you would be one hundred percent right. All of them. Every single one of them is unaccomplishable without having to hear about it in one form or another

It's closing in. slowly but surely people are turning to relationship styles of conversation, the net of unaccessible things is drawing tighter and tighter and now... there's nowhere for me to go. Nowhere for me to run to be away from it. It's been tormenting me for years and now it's finally overtaken everything about my life.

TL;DR I can't do this any more. People talking about relationships is completely unavoidable, and my innevitable suicide because of it draws near. I can't escape it. I tried. I tried so hard to get away but it caught me anyway"

Viuv,5avwbx,1478167666,So depressed and confused. So many problems and two weeks left till my daughter is born.,"I'm 29 and have been suffering depression on and off for 17 years. It has come back with a vengeance and for the past year I have found myself in a hole of despair every single day.

Rewind to a year and a half ago after battling for years with my emotions I had achieved some incredible things. I had a great job, good social life and great body.
These things did not come easy and I worked really hard to get a degree, find a job, battled through my social anxiety and depression and made friends and met a guy, sacrificed what felt natural to me (eating everything) to lose weight and kept up walking to look good.

One loose thread and It all unravelled...
(seems to be a theme I've encountered time and time again except this time I haven't been able to pick myself back up)

I was accused of doing something wrong at work and was unable to defend myself and got fired from my job, my relationship with my boyfriend became abusive, I begun to eat and eat again, became a recluse and lost my friends due to distancing myself...

Things with my bf aren't good, he is abusive and because of a lack of support and heavy depression I feel trapped in the relationship. I told him over and over I want to leave but he doesn't let me - abusing me for wanting to leave. I end up staying because I have no one else. I treat him good but he can't treat me good.

He told me he loves me and I believed him... he told me he wanted a baby with me... I loved that he wanted that. We made a baby... Things got really fucked....

I found us a place to live while he smoked pot and played video games. He was yelling at me about the houses I was looking at... So I found him what he wanted. Cheap house in the area he grew up in with a detached garage.

We moved in to an area foreign to me, for him. he became more horrible to me and basically lived in he garage smoking weed playing video games and masterbating or he'd have his younger stoner friends over and hang out with them and never spent time with me. We used to have a hot sex life but it went away, I wasn't even big yet when it started. He was being really mean to me all the time. I felt even more depressed. And he doesn't talk to me about my depression, and he doesn't show any empathy or compassion for me or an interest in me generally. My existence annoys him and I've never had someone treat me like that before so it broke my heart.

He became more abusive, picking fights and calling me a whore for no reason and saying the baby wasn't his. Later I found he had been looking at escort services in the area on his iPad. When I questioned him about it he yelled at me and threw me and our unborn babies belongings out on the pavement. I called the cops, they said it wasn't a serious DV case and refused to give me a restraining order. The police helped me bring my things back inside as I could not lift them due to being pregnant. He messaged me saying he was going to throw all my things out again tomorrow.

After that I left the house and stayed at my mothers house for a few days and he did not try to contact me. Over those few days I organised my life to move out of that house. On the Friday while he was at work I went to the real estate and handed back my keys, I went back to the house and packed for a few hours and had a removalist truck come. I moved in with my mother and stored my things in her garage. I have no where else to go.

Living with my mother is pretty shit. I had moved out at 17 due to us not getting along and now I'm 29 and pregnant and living with her again and hating her again. I feel like such a bad person. I'm so confused and lost.

He eventually called me again and was really remorseful and I agreed to see him and he was nice to me just like the old days. He said we should try to make things work coz we have a family on the way. Sounds good in theory but he doesn't want to change anything that bothered me (that I always pay for him, he works heaps but keeps his money to himself, that he smokes weed and it makes him angry, that he treats me badly, that I don't want these little stoners around the house all the time, that he's super super messy, unreliable, and has no routine and is always out partying with friends ... I remind him we have a baby on the way etc) so what's the point. When I try to talk to him about it he yells and sees things in right and wrong instead of compromise and apparently I'm never right.

He never offered to buy baby things or anything. I spent all my money preparing for her arrival and bought every single thing myself. 

He got 5 years worth of taxes back (totalling a $10,000 return) and said he was saving some of that money for the baby (yea right...heard this before... Knew he wouldn't...said nothing) then he told me he spent it all in four months on himself. He joined a baseball team, went on trips with his friends etc. He yells at me that I should come back and I said we'd see how things go... Until he chucked a tantrum at me and made me say yes. I still feel hesitant about that.

Still living at my mums and seeing him sparsely. He makes me drive it him, or he'll come over for two hours and say he has to go (to smoke weed) and not see me for another week.  I kept asking him gently from time to time to buy the baby something, anything, a toy, something.

He bought a teddy for her. It was $10. At some point I was talking to him about how he'd only spent $10 on the baby and he got angry saying ""sorry I didn't know I had to buy her an expensive toy and that the price tag mattered so much to you!"" I said ""no that's not what I meant the toy is lovely. I mean I've spent all my money buying her things and you've only contributed $10"" to which he said ""now I can't even give her that toy, you've tainted it""
Which is generally how all our conversations go. I feel like I'm going crazy.

I don't really want to stay or go back, he tells me I'm going to destroy her life and break the family because I'm being selfish. I think it's not really fair to make me feel like I don't have a choice. I do have a choice, but it's not much of a choice.

My mother is pretty insane and I hate being here.... in this house... the house I'd sworn I'd never ever return to in my whole life because of the relentless childhood sexual abuse I had suffered here at the hands of her father (now deceased... Rot in hell you sick fuck) I tried so hard to make sure id never return here and I ended up here. 

All I can think is....why has this happened to me??

If I go back to live with my boyfriend I'll have some level of freedom although ill be unhappy, and we will have our family together. I'll have to organise a lot of documentation again etc

If I go back I don't know for certain whether he will ever help me out financially like he always says he will but doesn't. I don't know if he will ever treat me better, if he will be faithful (a lot of evidence points towards him having cheated several times but always denies) if he will treat our daughter well.

A major thing is my unborn daughter. I didn't want this for her. And I'm so utterly depressed and confused about what to do.

 Do I want her to see this horrible relationship and grow up thinking this is how things work?
How will he treat her? He's so angry and unstable?
If I don't have him around, do I want her to see a broken family, with a struggling depressed mother?
I don't want her to grow up taking on my mothers mannerisms - she's a severely damaged human being (due to her father... later drug abuse...etc... she's had a messed up life). My mothers lack of life upsets me.

If I stay here I feel like he'll abuse me for it and threaten to kill himself like he always does when I want to leave. If I stay here at mums, it will take me at least a year to have saved enough to move out and even then I don't know how people afford it on their own with a child as rent is so Rediculously expensive. I've always lived in share houses. I'm at a loss. 

I don't know whether I can make it either way. Here or there, I'm so totally depressed and confused. I don't know what the right thing is for my unborn daughter.

This pregnancy has been so exhausting, emotional and stressful.
I'm so mad at him for not stepping up and being there for me. If he had been decent to me I could've enjoyed pregnancy and lifted myself up. Life has never worked that way for me. How stupid I was to think things could be better for me.

Because of all of these factors my depression has gotten so out of hand I am constantly anxious and crying and utterly stuck, not able to do anything with my days or escape from my mind. I can't work, can't spend money and see myself getting fatter and fatter it's so disgusting.

She'll be here in two weeks, and I'm not looking forward to it. I feel like I've failed her, I picked the wrong guy for a dad, (just like my dad), I'm almost exactly like my crazy mother... I don't want her to be like us. I'm so depressed and she deserves more. I've wanted to kill myself more times than I can count this year. 

She'll be here, and I'll be depressed. And I wish I was ok for her... and I'm not. I don't know what to do. This has been horrible. I want to die, but now I know I can't... For her.
What the hell was I thinking I should never have made a child. 
Look how horrible life is.. What can I possibly teach her that will help her survive? I am barely surviving. She already has a shit start and she's not even born yet. I feel so guilty and feel so much shame.

All I can hope for is that I will change and get better again like I have in the past (it's never taken so long to come out of severe depression before...) that's all I can do... is take small steps towards good... I have no idea which way to go right now to start that journey or if I'll even make it there. I'm just feeling so low, severely low. Indescribably low and there's not a clear win for me."

What if I don't want to put myself through the downs anymore? I don't care if it's shortsighted or selfish: why would I honestly choose to live if it means returning to the same dark place again and again? Sure, maybe what I'm experiencing will get better for now, but I will always slump back into depression.

This is my first time posting in this subreddit and how glad I was to have discovered this subreddit. I'm 16/M/161cm/171lbs and I'm currently on a diet right now. But today, I have succumbed to Binge Eating eating again after a month of not doing so. I'm pretty stressed right now. I'm currently in grade 11, studying in a British curriculum but I just came from a Filipino curriculum. It's pretty tough for me even though I was a pretty good student in my previous school cause British curriculum is on a whole new level compared to Filipino curriculum. I'm studying abroad and the tuition fee for my school is pretty expensive. We have our first mock examinations coming up in the third week of November and the syllabus composes of topics from grades 9-11. What's worse is that, in my previous school, our topics were pretty simple, easy and as compared to our topics right now. So basically, I have to start reading again from their grade 9 topics. I've been doing this since the start of school and it has taken a toll on me. I feel like my head's gonna explode because I need to get all C's in my mock exams in order for me to get to grade 12. If I don't, there's absolutely no chance for me to move up to grade 12. I don't want to waste the efforts that my parents are making to make money in order for me to go to school. I've been doing my best, but my best is just not enough, with this small allotted time. What should I do with my life now? I feel like a complete piece of shit right now, adding aside the fact that I may have lost my weight loss progress because of the excessive amount of calories that I have eaten today. I feel like I just want to get out of this world and not be a burden to my parents. I don't want to see the faces on my parents when I get grade that's lower than C in my mock examinations...

It didn't, and now I've graduated and I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing.

I can't drive, my dad hates me for it. It's always, ""You need to learn to drive, I hate taking you everywhere."" I want to, but I'm scared.

I am usually a pretty happy and positive guy 

I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. I put myself in a difficult situation. I made my two bestfriends hate my girlfriend and my girlfriend hate my two best friends. There is no solution to all this, they will never get along. The only tie they have to each other is me. I fucked up this summer and am now feeling the consequences. Hard. They have all been miserable these last 5 months and its killing me. I can't seem to make my girlfriend as happy as she deserves to be. I always end up hurting her, one way or another.

It would all go away for them if I were to go aswell. I have written a goodbye letter explaining why I have been considering the ""easy"" way out. Now I just have to figure out my preferred way of doing it.

I will probably do it next monday. I want to see my family one last time before I do it. I wanted to say goodbye to reddit one last time aswell.

Its the only way, I know that for a fact. In the long run, When I'm gone, three people will be a lot happier through their lives. They are amazing. I truly love you all.

It's been good, my life. It really has been. I hope my girlfriend finds someone to treat her properly, because she really is the greatest woman in the world.

That's all for now.

Bye

Fuck it, I just don't care anymore. Honestly, a part of me wants to kill myself right in front of her, so her last image of me can be me throwing myself off a building, and she'd know it's all her fault. "
gngnxx,5f1v2s,1480197722,I don't want to be here anymore,"I wish mental illness didn't exist, all it does is mess everything up. For the last few months, my depression and anxiety have been at its worst. I tried seeing a therapist (my 4th one) and a psychiatrist but they don't help. That therapist never had anything to say, it's like she felt awkward and just didn't know what to say. All the different medications never helped either. I've lost faith in them and I don't care to see a new one right now. 

I absolutely loathe myself.. I hate my looks, personality, lack of abilities.. just everything. No matter what I do, I'm just a failure. I can never push myself to continue to do anything because I'm never good enough. Someone like me will never amount to anything.. I don't even know what I want to do with my life. I don't even care to go to college right now. I'm not competent enough to do anything.. including getting a job. My pets deserve a better owner who can take care of them. 

Im tired of my dysfunctional family and lack of friends. But if I were to kill myself, my mom or brother might try it too. Just like the last time I tried to kill myself. Maybe that's why I haven't done it yet. I only have 1 friend that I can count on, but one day he's gonna leave just like everyone else did. All I am is a burden to him anyway.. he deserves a better friend than I can ever be. 

I love music and going to concerts.. but it's not enough to keep me here anymore. My chest always feels numb, empty, and full of heartbreak. I recently had stomach issues where I felt sharp stomach pain.. not surprised if it's from my mental illnesses. I haven't been eating that much and I'm losing weight. I just don't want to be here anymore...

Please.. if somehow I get a life threatening illness soon or if there's an opportunity for me to sacrifice myself for someone else.. please.. I'll take it. I don't have the strength to keep living anymore. I'm better off dead and everyone will be happier without me.. I'm WORTHLESS "

I've stopped trying in school because non of it matters if i kill myself. My grades are slipping and I just don't care. I've collected a massive store of drugs like codeine hyoscine, paracetamol, amyltryptamine and a bunch of others and I'm really tempted to overdose. I gave myself a date to do it- and that date was today the 25th of november. The temptation is so strong, it'd just be swallowing some pills and because of the variety of them there'd be nothing the doctors can do. I'd just die- gone from this world: not having to stress about exams, my future or friends- just death. I really don't know anymore. I'm only 15 but I feel its my time."

I'm trying to understand why i am feeling suicidal and i cant come up with the answer. The only thing that it maybe could be is that i'm lonely. but i am working on that with friends and dating, so that cant be it.

About a month ago i got sent to a crisis clinic and told them how i felt and they just talked to me about everything. Found out that I've been raised by an alcoholic, i left him three weeks ago. They told me that i cant blame him but that its possible i'm having these problems because of him. I'm now seeing a normal psychologist and she says i handle panic wrong. She also said i at least need to give it a couple months before i start to feel better. I cut and starve myself to the point of passing out. And it feels great. i think constantly about suicide, cant put it out of my head.
I cant keep going on this way
Don't know where to look anymore.

ill keep fighting but i'm afraid i will lose it.

franticantelope,5csoyz,1479078420,I gave it my all,"And now I'm just tired. I've dealt with PTSD since I was a kid, and now after a year of therapy I'm barely any better. Between that and the anti depressants I feel soulless and inhuman, able to feel emotions only when the sadness overwhelms me.

I'm a university student and one of the people I was gonna live with managed to, long story short, fuck up our entire apartment search to the point that I'm now gonna live on campus alone, with all my other friends having already found their place to live months ago.

It's my 21st birthday this week but I honestly don't care. I don't even want to have a party, maybe it's the depression speaking but my friend group has been drifting apart over months and I don't think anyone would even come. I'm completely sick of drinking and smoking but I also hate being sober. 

I've put so much effort into therapy and trying to recover but I feel the effects of sexual abuse constantly, it's inescapable. It's embarrassing to admit since it happened so long ago and wasn't violent but I'll honestly say it ruined my life. I have no real desire to be alive anymore haha, just some momentum. "

TheCommunistElephant,5fri4o,1480533266,I Don't Think It's Worth It to Try to Reach Such A Tiny Amount of Happiness.,"I can't do anything and I'm tired of trying to make it and failing. I'm not going to school and don't have a job. I can't do those things because my anxiety's too bad. I don't want to be supported by my mom my entire life. 

I'm so fucking useless and seeing everyone else be good and have fun makes me feel like shit. I wanna draw, and try to' and can't do it for shit. I can't do any of the things I want, I can't write, program, video edit or make music and I see all these people around me that can and it make me feel horrible. 

And on top of the success other people have that I can't, they have happiness I never will. Assuming I get over my anxiety and find sucess or something I'm good at, I can never enjoy things the way people do. Everyone has sex and does drugs and drink, and I'm not interested in those things. I wanna be interested in them 'cause all the people I've looked up to are into it seems like they've had so much with doing them. I don't want to be who I am. I want to be ""bad"" but I'm too scared and idealistic. I don't think I can reach the amount of happiness others can even if I do eventually get better. My potential is shit, and even reaching it I won't be happy.

I think most of all I want relationships. I want friends and a girlfriend. I haven't been able to talk to people for so long and I keep getting worse. Seeing other interact and have fun makes me feel and 'cause I can't have that, and then I feel worse 'cause I'm getting upset at people's happiness. I think I'm a bad person for thinking like this.

I don't see the point of trying to make it through life and get happiness if the amount of happiness I can reach is so little. Especially if I have to go through all this pain for so long and the little amount of happiness isn't garunteed."

I am sad all day everyday. I have no desire to live at all, haven't for many years now but this year has been the worst. 

I dont leave my house I'm NEET and the only person I ever have to talk to is myself. I think about killing myself all day everyday, and now I'm just going to do it. I have literally nothing to lose anymore. I fucking hate waking up every morning I wish I would just die in my sleep.


I have no hobbys or passions, depression has killed any thing I used to enjoy. I hate everything, and if I do start to enjoy something, the depression kicks in and its not fun for very long. I am literally a waste of space. I wish i could have been normal person and had friends a girl friend and all that shit, but I was cursed to be a shy autistic fuck up from the start.


I love my mum and that's why I have waited so long to finally go through with this, but now I don't care that it will upset her. Why should I go through a life of deppersion and loneliness just so I dont  hurt somebody else who will die some day anyways.

allissooncosplayer,5aokf3,1478070520,unemployed and homeless college grad,"Its been 6 months and I am now homeless and still unemployed. I got 3 degrees from one of the nations best colleges, I've done 3 internships, worked on TV shows and feature films (even a christopher nolan film)....I got a 3.7 GPA.......

but I had anorexia and bulimia in college the prevented me from really learning how to do anything or have any skills. I couldnt sit down and draw or practice...So now I'm a talentless idiot...never going to get a job. And if I do it will be a non creative job and I'll never get to do anything creative. Cause when I worked at a store it consumed my life. They treated me horribly and I stopped applying to real jobs....since i'm not in college I cant really get the time to learn things anymore...It makes me so sad that it hurts my chest...I feel like the people i know who take these ""pedestrian"" jobs know what they want to do...they bus or serve to be an actor or musician...but me I dont know what I want to do and I certainly don't have the skills for it...And i've never had the support for it. Everybody has told me I'm shit.

I still havent recovered from my eating disorders because I have to pay out of pocket for all doctor visits cause my mom messed up our health insurance. I still have doctor bills to pay and now starting tomorrow my $50,000 a year student loans...

my family doesnt talk to me. Havent talked to my dad in 4 years cause he crushed me dreams, insulted me, left my mom and has a new family with children. Mom is a trainwreck and triggers my eating disorders. Brother wont talk to me since graduation (worst day of my life).

im running out of money. I live in a room with my boyfriend in his parents house and I can barely leave it cause I cant afford to waste gas in my car. I cant talk to his parents cause they think im a failure and I feel so uncomfortable there. Sometimes I sleep in my car. Sometimes I dont slepe at all. He is a musician and leaves a lot to tour...I have to leave the room in 2 weeks, with all my stuff and I dont have anywhere to go. 

I really want to end it all. All my friends are achieving and doing great things. They dont know im homeless and want to kill myself. I'm worried theres nothing left for me. It kills me since I did so much and tried so hard in college. Now i have debts, all my teachers and parents crushed my dreams, I can't do anything I see my friends do, and theres really no point. Either my ED will kill me or myself. this was a ramble...I'm sorry. I just don't know where to turn now....I wasted everybody in my life's time and money. And now I'm out of both....i need help but i cant even get it "
TA6687246,5b3cko,1478263722,Feel like I messed up my life quite a bit.,"Some background:

Currently a senior engineering student in university but the sudden increase in workload has caused me to stress out to the point where I can't find the motivation/discipline to keep going. So now I'm failing most of my classes and have a very bleak output of the future. 

The biggest thing I'm worried about is that I will have to take at least another semester at least to graduate and the university I attend only gives 8 semesters of scholarship, so each additional semester will be around $13,000. I don't want to burden myself or my family with huge student debt loans and was the main reason I went to this particular university, but now I feel like a giant hypocrite since I'll likely have to pay up anyway if I want to graduate.

I've also done a few internships and I realize they aren't representative of an actual job, but I didn't seem to fit in well with the work environment. I know work isn't always fun but I'd like to find something I can at least tolerate and feel fulfilled. 

Again, this all leads into the whole bleak output of the future.

So now I'm seriously contemplating suicide as these thoughts are also weighing down my ability to enjoy life.

I've yet to tell my parents about my situation as they have fairly high expectations of me and I don't want to disappoint them. 

So in summary: I've got a poor outlook on my immediate future, and then even if I do graduate I have little hope of finding a job that I'll actually enjoy just to live. Also my parents are hoping I make it big and I don't want to disappoint them.

I'm sure other people have experienced a similar situation to mine and I'd like to hear how you coped with it and found a bigger purpose in your life.

DongDongExtreme,5fghek,1480391878,I want to suffer,"This is a sentiment I've run into multiple times throughout my experiences with depression, especially recently. Whenever I'm feeling depressed, I don't want to get better, I want to feel as much pain and anguish as I can - be it physical or mental. I want to feel despair so deep I have nothing to live for anymore.

I can't really explain it, but even though people want me to get better, all I want to do is wallow in my pain. I don't want to get better. I want to suffer. Nobody around me gets it when I try to explain it to them. Imagine you're in physical pain, you have a knife in your leg or something. When a doctor comes to help you take it out you refuse help and just lay there on the floor, absorbing every second of pain you can. That's what it's like."

Now when I wake up, everything I do feels meaningless. While you can argue I can do this for myself, I don't feel a sense of pride at all. I have many achievements. But all of them are meaningless. I cannot feel happy when she is not happy. 

I am going through the days with a numb mind. I am so eternally bored and empty. I am so tempted to text her ""hey! I got a job"" or ""do you want to hang out?"" But I know it will make things complicated. 

Everything I do feels meaningless. I'm in a void. I can't move without her. I can't find meaning without her. My dreams and goals are dry and gray without her.

I feel gone when she is gone. Life feels so underwhelming. "

I had this idea, of flying to Arizona and killing myself in the desert. I have crunched the numbers, made the plans. Its so illogical but yet i feel called to do this. That doing this will solve my problems. 

I need help, i need an intervention. But the problem is getting help will ruin my life just as killing myself would. It seems that it would actually be worse because getting help means I have to pick up the fall out. I have no idea what to do. I dont *want* to die..

Ttthrowytt,5c6g9p,1478759568,I'm deaf and going blind too,"I'm 23M and I have no friends in person. I only had one in college and then moved to a new city for a job. 

Meeting friends is extremely hard for me. I'm deaf in both ears. I use an implant that makes it hard to understand if there is background noise. People aren't genuinely interested in talking to me though. They just want to patronize me to feel better about themselves and win PC points. 

I thought I could just be alone forever, but it is soul crushing after 10 months of nothing but work and internet. 

My mom is a grade a toxic and she emails me all the time trying to get me to feel guilty about something or other. She's painted herself as the victim to her family and my deceased father's, who are very conservative immigrants who hate me because of what she tells them. She does it for no reason whatsoever. I grew up with this treatment and my father taking my side and nobody else believing me about her. 

I just want to end it from those things alone, and I have spent a long time looking up methods. To make things worse, my gay friend flew home to his family in a Muslim country that beheads homosexuals...it was back in September when he left and I never heard from him again. I'm up late worried something happened to him.

I also woke up after a nap today and my vision in one eye is very blurry. I'm panicking and have to wait to get into an eye doctor. Being already deaf, if I go blind, there is literally no point to being alive. I wouldn't be able to do my job or have any enjoyment. I wonder if I should just end it"

Spartanlaw77,5dlk55,1479461159,Fear of Jumping,"Hi. This is my first post, so, any help is appreciated.

I am married, two kids - one lives with me, the other is 15000 km away, with my ex wife. I have a decent job, and everything that I possibly may want.

I always had this irrational fear of heights, nothing can explain it, as i have no problems with glass lifts, or airplanes. Just windows, balconies and edges.

A few years ago, I realised that it wasn't fear of heights. 

It was the urge to jump.To end it all. Oblivion.

My best moments during the day are when i'm holding my son, playing with him, or playing online games with my friends. 

My wife is becoming a stranger, incapable of noticing these changes, my family has no idea of all of this, and i have no one to discuss this with.

Don't get me wrong, I love my wife, but she's more distant by the day, always finding a reason to be away from me. No infidelities, just... distance.

I find myself being the yes, ma'am, so i can stay away from arguments. Avoiding her seems to do the trick for a while. For a while.

Thanks for reading this.

It means a lot."
ThrowawayMan6666,5bfx5f,1478441916,Slowly considering it,"I have always been a very depressed and socially unlucky guy, but I am slowly getting frustrated and angry with it at this point in my life.

I have been trying to go on many dates with girls for the chance to form something, anything, it never happens, I have tried everything, 14 different hookup and/or dating apps of the course of 11 months. From generic ""heys"" to actual and witty intros I either came up with myself or was suggested from various parts of the internet.

I tried everything, maybe wrote my self summaries dozens of times over.

I am not *unnattractive* per say, I mean I am no Leonardo DiCaprio, far from it, but I am not *that* ugly I guess, I have a slim average build, I have been told I have an amazing sense of humor, I am a hopeless romantic.

But It's as if I have this ""aura"" around me that makes people ignore me, forget me or reject me. No matter what I do something goes wrong and I am always the last to know what it was, sometimes I wonder if I went into a conscious coma and fucked something up while sleepwalking, THAT is how confused I am, when I think I said nothing wrong (or never even spoke at all) it's like I did do something wrong.
If you told me there was a guy that is impersonating me and acting like the rudest, most arrogant douche to make the real me look bad, I'd believe you, that is how surreal this all feels to me.

Sometimes I feel like a ghost that only my family and a select few can see, sometimes there are points I feel no one can see me or remember me.

I am so lonely, so soul-wrenchingly lonely that I will never have sex, never have someone to hold close, all these things no matter how hard I try, I fail.


I wanna die, put an end to my consciousness as a whole. I just want someone to take pity on me, to help me or understand me.

I can't find this person, and it's eating away at me.

Does anyone know what I must do? And please please don't tell me to love  myself before expecting other people to love me.
I don't want to hear it, it's all nonsense because I need someone else to make happy to remind myself I am normal, human, not a ghost, not a social reject.

From an early age I've been searching for answers. As an eighteen year old these feelings are something I cannot escape from even today I'm constantly searching for and seeking answers to my questions. Does life really have purpose value or meaning? what I am doing? where am I going? is this it? Because of my NEVER ending existential crisis, I've been suffering from bouts of depression since I was 10. Which leads to severe suicidal thoughts. I don't understand life. If we're gonna die, if we have to construct our own worlds and lives, and if we're ultimately alone, then what's purpose does life have? I don't like life. I don't understand why I'm alive. I won't be the one to find the cure to cancer, I won't be the one to world hunger or poverty. I won't do anything worthy of remembrance. I am just a waste of space on Earth. I've never been loved before, and I know I am not worthy of love. I don't know how to love. I don't have a emotional connection with anybody in life.

mimicrying,5dajrd,1479318314,need to vent,"the mental health industry is a load of bullshit guys. let me give some backstory. so, if you read my older posts here you'll get more insight, but basically it took forever to finally get permission to see a specific psychiatrist. we call her up and... she's not accepting new patients. whoop dee fucking doo. thankfully, my old therapist recommended me a psychologist on a whim. i go see him, he seems great, but me being an idiot, i ask how to cope with how much i want to kill myself, and it turned into this whole thing where he didn't know whether to let me go home or not.

we schedule another appointment just two days later, and i get there expecting therapy. nope. it's intervention. i either get assessed by the intake unit or leave and find some other therapist. really ugly stuff. it's like they want you to kill yourself. anyways, i go to intake but i'm left to wait for two fucking hours with no assessment. by this point i'm rocking back and forth, scared shitless as my brain chants paranoia, so i demand (ask, albeit with no shit) to be let go. i need clearance to leave which takes an HOUR, only i'm told i got clearance soon after i asked, the staff is just negligent and didn't realize i was still there (really?). i walk out. then as the weekend passes, i go back, knowing yeah, my therapist will not see me until i do this assessment. i get it done. i call my therapist. he can't see me until i do IOP (intensive outpatient), which is what they placed me in based on my assessment. i go to one session and... complete bullshit. complete basic ""i get sad sometimes"" general bullshit, using a video from what must be the 80s. i have personality disorders! this type of thing will *not* work for me! i call my therapist, he tells me to come in. i say it's bs, he kind of agrees but it's protocol. he then suggests i join a dbt group at a clinic in the same building which he says is good, i say sure whatever. i need clearance to be let into that program and to cancel the IOP. i haven't gone to IOP since that first visit, it's been two weeks. over 1 week with no word from the dbt clinic. IOP calls me, asks why i haven't been going, i say it's because it's not for me and my therapist wants me in the dbt program, they say they'll call the clinic. no. word. since. 

i called yesterday, asking if they had any info. silence.

they want you to stay sick. they want you to suffer. they want you to get so hopeless all you can do is say ""yes yes yes"" to medicine, to treatment, to every will of theirs. they don't give a shit how i feel.

i asked my therapist what would happen if i said no to the IOP and dbt program since he refuses to see me until those are over. his response? i'd probably end up in a hospital. and that there are other therapists out there.

fuck this industry. fuck society for prioritizing their feelings over yours, how you can't kill yourself because it'd make others sad. fuck off. i want to die cuz i'm sad, but that doesn't mean jack to anyone as long as i'm alive. i'm not allowed peace, only they are. "

bkww,5ejsy7,1479935661,My girlfriend is really depressed and only wants to push me away,"Hey everyone, this is the third time im posting here and got good results so far.
I wanted to talk about one thing in particular, my girlfriend is usually depressed by the dumbest things and we get over it pretty easily but something happened this weekend. 
I was invited to her mom's birthday but I have some kind of social anxiety and makes me somewhat uncomfortable. I talked this with her and she said that it was ok if I didn't go, didn't matter that much as we were going to see each other last monday.

On saturday I told her I was a little scared to go, asked if it was fine and she said yes but she sounded bitter, like she was kind of mad. I actually asked her if she was and she said no.  All the evening she was with her friends at a beer event we had here, and she sounded quite happy. When she went home, she had her mom's party but she told me she was mad at me and wanted space/time.

Since then, I've been having anxiety attacks because I feel guilty for not going despite it being pretty much justified. She got into a fight with her mom and she felt pretty bad. Also I spoke to her a couple times and she's mad at me for not respecting her space but the anxiety was killing me, I can't even eat or sleep properly right now.

Now she wants to break up a 5 month relationship because of this, and she even told me to fuck off, that im disgusting or even that I cause her rejection. She's never like this, only when she's depressed but still it hurts a lot and I'm the kind of guy who loves her unconditionally and did everything to make her happy, even bought her a gift for our 5th month which was the same day in case I went to the party.

I understand her being mad at me but I already apologized and felt guilty after that. We barely talk now, she wants to break up but it's pretty much pointless, she already tried to break up before and we are still here.

I don't even know what to do, at first she wanted space to calm down about what happened and now it scales to breaking up? I know her a lot and she's probably feeling guilty and wants to push me away from her because she thinks she's awful but I just love her too much and if im not there for her I don't know who will. 

We're probably gonna meet this weekend and talk about it but I just don't know, I feel so bad I don't know what to do and I'm scared she might do something crazy. I'm worried because she doesn't even sound logical anymore, she might be going through a lot but she only wants me away, either for giving her a chance of killing herself (she said a couple times im the one that keeps her alive) or just for my own health, which is kind of her but I don't want to, I just want both to be good and happy together and stop this from happening.

She's been depressed since I met her and she's been doing really good but this last weekend she exploded and im pretty weak too, I try to be positive and everything but it hurts when your girlfriend tells you to fuck off or ""I don't need you"".

I don't know if someone will read this but at least I wanted to share a bit of my experience going through this."
nomorepitbull,5ch1my,1478900056,"I'm not normal, and I don't even have a Facebook account.","Hello, I'm 16 and I'm not OK. I didn't fit in until now, and I don't think I will ever do it. Most of the people I try to talk to, know that there is something wrong with me, and I think that they don't consider me a friend. I think friendship must be mutual. 

The thing is that I don't know why someone would want to be friends with me. Although I try, I still suck at everything. I'm as charismatic as a potato and I don't know a lot of people. My hobbies include basketball, some books that I never finish, movies, guitar, TV shows, but It doesn't matter if I can't speak about them.I think that you can see if someone doesn't have friends, in their behaviour. So it's obvious in me.

The closest thing I had to a friend was a 24 years old guy from the church. He was nice and we used to talk about religion and other stuff at least 1 time a week.I waited for that moment every week. But he moved to another city 3 months ago and I miss him a lot.

I don't know why I wrote this, and I'm sorry for being incoherent and pathetic. English isn't my native language and I'm also an idiot.

I have friends, surprisingly good health though a bit overweight, no debts and a decent home with good TV WiFi etc.
 Yet it's not enough.
I have no family since my Mother died four years ago. I have bouts of depression since. I'm not married or in a relationship but through choice as I have refused many chances.

 But something odd has made me aware of what is fundamentally wrong: a much younger female colleague showed some interest in me which I ignored, not wanting to make life difficult, though I was flattered and interested.

However, over the last months my feelings for her have grown as the more we talk the more I realise how much we think alike. However, she now has a boyfriend.

But it's made me realise that so many of my decisions were wrong; I'll never attract a woman like her again, I'll never have another long term relationship, I'll never have a daughter. I'll always be second best to someone else.

I exist to continue my existence. I have had many opportunities and interesting life events and positions but the whole has never equalled the sum of the parts.

I feel a fat, middle aged fool of no importance who simply ages toward nothing.

I have the method for suicide available and every Sunday I wonder why I don't just end this pointless existence. I truly hope death is nothingNess. 

I feel like a failed experiment and a fraud. People at work remark on my intelligence and 'wisdom' and i feel I am truly neither.

 I want to jump off the train before the inevitable crash."
MrCarroca,5csbb1,1479073926,Lost Hope,"

I honestly am not sure love in any form is real right now. My family have all failed me and the only ""romantic relationship"" I have ever been in was abusive.  I am crushed right now mentally. I am 16 years old and I have been clinically diagnosed with PTSD and depression. 

A few months ago I was basically forced into leaving my mother's house. I felt unsafe while I was over there.  I used to live in both of my parents houses equally as they are divorced. My Mom said to me that my siblings and I made her feel like she wanted to check out. She stole $400 from me and when I confronted her about this she yelled at me.  She told me not to call her mom.  Told me I should just leave.  So I did. My younger siblings flocked to her side,  I suppose that is a natural reaction. 

My Dad is constantly overbearing.  I can't even make a fire outside (I'm a Boy Scout,  this is normal) without him accusing me of self harm.  I did that once in May but he still accuses me of doing it again, weekly basis.  I get that this is from a place of caring but this hurts. 

My Stepsister has caused so much pain in my life.  In freshman year she spread rumours around the school that I was a stalker and that I was into her,  as revenge for me telling her mom about her abusive,  rapist,  druggie boyfriend that she had at the time. 

My ex-girlfriend was sexually and emotionally abusive.  She got me to do whatever she wanted by threatening suicide. She did a great deal to break me.

Up until Thursday of last week I had hope. 

I had forgiven my stepsister.  There was this girl I had a crush on.  I wanted to get to know her better so I asked my stepsister for help.  I thought I could trust her.  She gave me the girl's number and we started to text. I was banking on her liking me back.  That it would finally be time for things to go well in my life. 

I got this text from her saying that my stepsister had told her that I liked her. Of course on the first day that I had ever texted her.  Before she even really got to know me at all. She told me that she wasn't interested in a relationship. Maybe that would have happened anyways but my stepsister was the catalyst at the very least. 

I don't honestly believe anything in my life will work out.  I have no support from my friends or family.  I have lost the will to live I guess, being religious (Roman Catholic) is barely holding me back.  "

Been wrestling with major depression for a few years now.  I feel worthless I'm 24 years old and have little to live for or going in my life.  Finally got to the point I had ECT this past summer and I felt somewhat boosted for a while, and it changed some things chemically in my brain feels like but I'm feeling strongly trapped, panicked and hopeless now.

I have been in counseling and switched to a new counselor last spring my old one wasn't working.  She's good but I quit going recently because I just feel like what's the fking point anymore.  I don't feel like heeding or doing what told to it just doesn't click to do so.  

I may want to die because I can't handle life and just wasting it anyway.  I've accomplished very little in my life, and hell I can't even bring myself into a job!  I do get help from my towns DVR department but it's just not feeling like it's going anywhere either.

I'm just really afraid to die and if my life should end this way.  I'm afraid of an afterlife and even though not existing would be nice and peaceful still have a natural fear of it.  Afraid of the process also.

This is a long string of girls harshly rejecting me and directly or indirectly insulting me afterwards.

Theescapist87,5ctbr1,1479086429,I'm just ready for this to be over,"I've been suicidal on and off for pretty much the past 10 years of my life.

Fast forward 5 years and I met my ex who turned out to be suicidal as well. I actually saved his life at one point and we fell madly in love. However it didn't last since I fucked up and chose my current husband over him. He died 4 years ago which brought my depression back with a vengeance and I haven't been the same ever since.

Most days I'm okay, but I've been looking at my life and I don't see it going anywhere. I spend most of my days going through the motions of life and find myself basically just counting down until my death comes. I know James M. Barrie was right when he said ""to die would be an awfully big adventure"", which kinda sucks as it makes suicide look like the only possible way for me to get out of this purgatory that is life.

I see no point in me living anymore, and the only thing that has really stopped me from just ending my life is my nephews. I don't want to hurt them but I don't want to keep going through life like this either. I have one passion in life and my husband just called it a worthless hobby so there goes that too I guess. 

Everyday I wake up, I just hope that it will be my last day here. I'm done with living on this Earth."
million2329,5c4u7u,1478737851,Why do I want to kill myself,"I feel foolish for thinking the way I do but I really can't help it. I really have no one in my life who I can open up with and be 100% honest to, I feel like I'm drowning in emotion from the inside out and there is no way out except to end my life. 

I have been in love with a girl for almost 2 years now and we recently started dating 5 months ago. You would think this should make me happy and it does, she is one of the only reasons I don't just off myself right now. 

The relationship is awkward though, we work together and I'm her boss unfortunately if anyone at our job found out we were together we would both be fired so our relationship is completely closet and hush hush. 

I'm a very emotional person and I care way too much about this girl, yet something inside me tells me that she just doesn't feel the same way at all and it literally eats me up inside to think about it. We have been living together for a little bit now and sometimes when we go to bed at night I'll wake up in the morning and she will be in the spare bedroom sleeping alone, it upsets and frustrates me, it makes me feel like she doesn't want to be next to me or that I'm undesirable to her. I've told her how it makes me feel yet again today I woke up and she was in the spare bedroom, her excuse was that I took all the blankets and she was cold.

I freaked out and told her that if she wanted to date me that she had to come back to the bedroom, she never came so I told her I would find a place and be out in two weeks. We haven't spoke all day and she is out to church right now. Ever since she left I've done nothing but think about how worthless I must be and search ways to kill myself peacefully. 

I've had these thoughts before and I really just don't know what to do anymore, I'm hoping that venting on here will help me with the feelings as I have no one I can really open up to."
Throwidk493,5czg6j,1479169072,My social anxiety disorder has ruined my life. Time to end it.,"Since I was 13 I got hit with major anxiety and I have no idea why. I was cautious about every aspect of my body that it was extremely excessive. 

I was so skinny at 13 that it was boarderline anorexia and I would always look at my body and think that I was too fat and compare myself to others. I went on a online BMI calculator at least two times a week to see if I was skinny enough. I would also worry about how I dressed. I would excessively worry about what I'm going to wear and if people are going to judge me. Whenever I'm in public, I always wear my hoodie because I felt like I was naked/exposed without it. All of these things gave me panic attacks so severe I felt like I was going to faint. 

For school, it was a absolute nightmare. I missed 1/3 of school because some days my anxiety was so severe that I had to stay home. I would always make excuses to my parents to hide my problem. 

Whenever my friends ask me to hangout with them I always hesitate because I just can't do it. I never do anything on weekends either. And it just made me even more isolated and depressed and guilty that it's my fault I have this.

I know that I'm not a introvert, I want to go out, go with my friends, go partying, do things but I just can't. I've been isolated for 3 years and I don't expect it to go away sooner or later.

Currently 15 and the past 3 years have been wasted. My social anxety isn't that bad like it was before, but it's still in the back of my head and it's just tearing me apart mentally.

Thinking about ending it."
SweerMortem,5cifs6,1478918093,I'm so tired,"By rights I should be doing great right? I have a family that cares about me, a Girlfriend that loves me, enough money to go to college and not even have to work a job. I'm tall, fairly athletic, people tell me I'm funny and good looking and intelligent. But I'm just not feeling it anymore. I decided to go to university two states away for what I thought would be a nice change of pace. I wouldn't even be all that alone because my older brother is down here already and hey, I shouldn't have all that much trouble making friends right? But I've ended up all alone. My wonderful girlfriend is two states away as are all of my friends. My relationship with my parents has been tense lately due to various reasons and it doesn't appear to be improving. I'm a decent student but I'm failing 3 out of 4 of my classes pretty much beyond repair, which means i'll only have a single class to show for half a year of my life and a ton of money. It's not even that the workload is overwhelming or the tests are too hard, I just don't have any motivation to succeed. I have anxiety and depression and I'm on my meds. I don't enjoy any of the things I used to do for fun. I've tried going to all my hobbies but all of them come up empty. I have attempted to start new hobbies but I find no interest in them. I have made no friends here in the first semester, most of my classes are lectures and so i don't meet anyone from there and my roommate and the guys on my floor aren't the answer. They're nice guys and all but they aren't very good or intelligent people and all they really do is talk about girls and do drugs. Not that I can judge on the drugs front, I'm currently taking or drinking every substance I can get my hands on because the only time I really enjoy out of the week is when I'm not sober. So yeah, I've failed most of my college classes and my parents aren't happy about it. I don't enjoy anything anymore. Overall I just can't bring myself to care, I know a lot of my problems in life are solvable if I just put in effort, but to what end? I've been wrestling with the idea of killing myself for the past month or two and it only seems more appealing as time goes on. They say wait three days or a week before trying to kill yourself and its been a month. I might actually do it."

I promised them I'd take care of them for the rest of their lives but I don't want to stay awake for 10+ more years. I have a guaranteed, peaceful method available to me, I could fade out and be gone within 15 minutes, and cease to exist. My parents wouldn't take care of them though, my one friend is allergic, another one has 7 cats now and I just don't know if he can handle 2 more. I love them dearly and I can't leave unless I know they are going to be loved and cared for for the rest of their lives. It pains me so much to keep living for them, I don't want to exist anymore."
0berry,5f36st,1480214878,My life isn't mine.,"I've been thinking about this all week. And it's some kind of truth that has been apparent for a very long time. My parents made me believe I was their possession. I am still a prisoner in their home. I'm starting to accept this, that they will keep me in their insane reality forever. That I will be harassed daily for just existing, stalked if I dare go outside, have to deal with the creepy obsessiveness and fake love and attention. Having to deal with my baby sister getting hurt all the time, like I'm reliving my own childhood trauma. I didn't need to be born but I came into this world anyway. I don't know how to leave. I can't physically hurt myself and I have a fear about swallowing pills. It's frustrating...because I have to live with a lot of pain too and it would be nice to have an easy way out. I do exist and no one has really made me feel like this is right. I have suffered and I try to reach out but it's like people make me feel like I'm crazy for believing that I'm suffering. My other sister broke my heart and she won't even acknowledge what she's done, I trusted her and I need to talk to her but she's not the person I thought she was. Her loyalty to my sociopath of a mother is just too strong. I feel disgusted with myself that I shared so much information with her about my depression. I do therapy and it's helped me open my eyes to these horrible truths. I am not strong enough now I know nobody is on my side. Or it's more like being deceived to believe that I have so much support from my family when in reality they have been destroying me. And keeping me isolated from everything that could have been good for me. I have myself and this used to comfort me a lot...but not now. I don't recognise my face, don't feel like I'm existing or my body is real...i have done things like starve myself and I can't even feel the pain from that. I feel a bit sick whenever I realise how much food I'm not eatibg, how much weight I'm losing....I have horrible health problems because of being underweight for a decade. I could go on and on but this is really upsetting to write out. I don't feel my emotions anymore but I cried a lot just now. These are things I can't say in the real world and I still hope that one day I can express myself and have people care. But this hope is destroying me because I can't let go if it and I know I'm alone so I'm living with contradictions."

Whatkindofsoupisthat,5d7f62,1479272039,This is beautiful. This is what I imagine. Beauty after burden.,"You want a physicist to speak at your funeral. You want the physicist to talk to your grieving family about the conservation of energy, so they will understand that your energy has not died. You want the physicist to remind your sobbing mother about the first law of thermodynamics; that no energy gets created in the universe, and none is destroyed. You want your mother to know that all your energy, every vibration, every Btu of heat, every wave of every particle that was her beloved child remains with her in this world. You want the physicist to tell your weeping father that amid energies of the cosmos, you gave as good as you got.

And at one point you'd hope that the physicist would step down from the pulpit and walk to your brokenhearted spouse there in the pew and tell him that all the photons that ever bounced off your face, all the particles whose paths were interrupted by your smile, by the touch of your hair, hundreds of trillions of particles, have raced off like children, their ways forever changed by you. And as your widow rocks in the arms of a loving family, may the physicist let her know that all the photons that bounced from you were gathered in the particle detectors that are her eyes, that those photons created within her constellations of electromagnetically charged neurons whose energy will go on forever.

And the physicist will remind the congregation of how much of all our energy is given off as heat. There may be a few fanning themselves with their programs as he says it. And he will tell them that the warmth that flowed through you in life is still here, still part of all that we are, even as we who mourn continue the heat of our own lives.

And you'll want the physicist to explain to those who loved you that they need not have faith; indeed, they should not have faith. Let them know that they can measure, that scientists have measured precisely the conservation of energy and found it accurate, verifiable and consistent across space and time. You can hope your family will examine the evidence and satisfy themselves that the science is sound and that they'll be comforted to know your energy's still around. According to the law of the conservation of energy, not a bit of you is gone; you're just less orderly. Amen.

AccioMotherfucker,5drqs7,1479547269,I get paid in two weeks on the 28th. I'm thinking of buying a cheap shotgun and ending it.,"I'm a drug addict. I use cocaine, opiates, alcohol, benzos, and heroin occasionally. I've been diagnosed with bipolar for a few years and I guess I do the drugs to self-medicate.

Well I went to the psychiatrist and went though 60 pills in one way (30x 1mg clonazepam and 30x Temazepam) and I'm tired of this roller coaster. I can't stand it anymore. My wife and I have been married for almost 5 years and last night in the car we were talking about my abuse issues. I told her I've tried to get help so many times and it never works. I'm an addict and that's it. 

I asked if she would be okay without me, and she said ""I would make do without you, I could raise the kids myself, move back with my parents, etc.""

So I told her that she has until the end of the month to make a decision. Does she want me in her life or not? I told her to have fun explaining to the kids that their father won't be around anymore. This is all I ever wanted out of life. A wife and kids who love me. I want to see my little boys grow up (4yo and 6mo) and they absolutely adore me.

I've always had suicidal tendencies and I'm tired of being a drug addict with a mental disorder. My bipolar will not go away as I get older, I'll be there forever, and right now it feels like my marriage won't.

I have a problem, though. I don't want to hurt anyone. I know they'll be hurt but in her words ""I'll get over it.""

I've been thinking about this for a while now. Do I need to write a will or something like that? It should be painless if I use buckshot. I can walk into any gun store and walk out with a shotgun + ammo within two or three hours.

2017 was supposed to be good to me. I got a good job, moving to  a new place, etc,. People WILL miss me. People WILL hurt when they realize that I will never be around anymore to make them laugh and smile.

I won't get to see my baby smile anymore, or read beditime stories to my oldest. Never again will I kiss my wife's lips or hold her when she cries.

She put the straw on the camel's back It's happening. Of course I can't tell a psych. because they will lock me up for 3 days and that'll do nothing.

Cranksta,5bk9a8,1478492803,"I'm tired, lonely, and losing hope in life.","I broke up with my SO of three years a month ago. Or maybe he broke up with me. I don't know really. He seemed pretty happy to go either way. Probably had been wanting to for a long time and just didn't tell me. I tend to have that effect on people. They leave pretty quickly when they get tired of me. 

I was abused as a kid. No surprise I'm completely inept at life. I'm a 4.0 student and a good employee, but that's about all I can claim. I'm unhappy and lonely and I have no one to turn to anymore. My brother told me I could talk to him, but I just can't do it anymore. I use him like I use everyone else. I can't bring myself to bother him anymore knowing that about myself. I've given up on love, I'm not sure I even felt it in the first place. I'm not sure I can feel love. I attach to people yes, but I can't care for them the way they care for me. I'm a black hole of time, energy, and emotions. 

I wont see my therapist for a month. I missed my last appointment and now I'm stuck with this. Even if I did see her soon, I'm not sure I could say what I really felt. I'd get committed. My family would be forced to pay the bill and I'd lose my job. I don't want to be more of a loser than I already am. If I'm ready to go, then I'd like to do it successfully, not make everyone stress and strain about keeping me alive out of some obligation. No, I don't want to live, and no you can't convince me it's worth it. 

It's really not. I've been cold and alone my entire life. I thought I found a good place to land but it's crumbling just like everything else. I'm in school, but the thought of me actually being a doctor makes me scoff. I'm not going to make it, I'm just keeping myself busy. My family were pretty happy to have me in the beginning, but the novelties worn off and now they're stuck with the reality. I'll never be able to be like them. Especially now with my niece on the way. I have no place in her life, and truthfully I'm not sure I want one. I'm not someone she should learn from. She'll learn nothing but misery. 

I'm so tired all the time now. I can fake it at work, the sociability, the friendliness, the kindness, but it's not who I am. I fear people. I hate people. People are dangerous. Yet I yearn for their presence in my life. I don't understand it. I am not a whole human being, I'm just a void that takes down everything around me. Why do I wish to be with people when I know exactly how it will end? I don't get it.

I'm not smart. Or pretty. Or funny. That's who I am when I'm faking. If they really knew me, they'd call me a monster. They'd run.

My mother was right. Everything she said while brutalizing me was right. I should have died a long time ago. I'm finally getting closer to finishing what she started. It's just a matter of time.

But I'm lonely. That one stubborn emotion remains. I wish I could just turn it all off. It'd be easier that way."
username2409,5f3o2i,1480221926,I don't know where else to ask this.,"I truly, truly believe that I have absolutely no real impact on this earth whatsoever and the people who ‘love’ me, like family, only do so because it’s like an instinctual, relative, in–the–blood kind of thing; so my no longer existing really won’t make any difference at all. 

I am not good at anything. I am fat. I am ugly. I am a bad person. I am unfixable. I am lonely. I am different. I am not ambitious. I am unhappy in everything I do. I am unable to make others happy. I have no abilities, talents or personality traits that make any difference to the world in any way.

I have no friends. I am a terrible girlfriend. I barely keep in contact with my family. I am just getting fatter every year. I hate myself more and more every day.

The only thing that makes me even the slightest bit happy any more is my boyfriend – but I know I don’t make him happy. It’s pretty obvious to everyone who knows us that he would be far better off without me, because I am just a huge, idiot burden who is bringing down a very intelligent and ambitious person who should not be with someone like me. He is still with me because we’ve been together since we were quite young and it’s all we know. He doesn’t even realize how much better he could have it. Maybe he does, but he just doesn’t know how to leave such a shitty, emotional person like me.

He’d be better off without me; everything would be better with out me.

I don’t understand why it’s bad to want to die. I honestly think it’s just the most logical decision for me, it makes sense in so many ways, why shouldn’t it be an okay thing to do if that is all I want?

I know where my life is going. Soon I will have to leave my job because it stresses me out so much. I won’t have any money. I’ll have to move back home. He will leave me. I will (still) have no friends. I’ll become even more depressed than I am now. And then I will kill myself.

Why not skip all that shit? I am not asking for pity. I am not asking for someone to help me. I just want to know if anyone out there can possibly imagine for a moment that maybe there is someone on this earth who genuinely deserves to not live any more, and maybe that person is me."
DongDongExtreme,5dksdu,1479446822,Suicide isn't sad or scary anymore,"I've been suicidal for years, but something has changed. Back in 2011, thinking about suicide would bring me to tears. In 2013, it made me feel sad, but I didn't always cry thinking about killing myself. Fast forward to now, after being suicidal every single day for the past 3-4 months, I've suddenly realized that suicide isn't something that scares or disturbs me anymore - I don't feel sad, I don't feel scared, it just feels neutral. Even when I'm not explicitly sad or depressed, all I can think about is killing myself. It feels like the only rational decision I can make. Every day is either apathy or depression, and checking out is feeling more and more like the right thing to do. I can be happy and around friends, laughing and having fun, but in the back of my mind all I can think about is coming home and ending it all. Again, it doesn't feel emotional, it feels the same as wanting to make a sandwich or put on a film - it's purely neutral.

It's a strange feeling. Does anyone else feel the same way?"

I'm 17 years old and in high school (grade 12) right now my grades are falling fast even though they need to be high to get in a decent college. I'm probably not gonna get into college let alone get my High School Diploma. 

I also happen to have a pointless crush on a girl in one of my classes. Which makes me even more lonely than I already am. It's stupid because we haven't even talked to each other yet because she's on the other side of the room and I'm too introverted/socially awkward to approach her. I'm constantly dealing with self loathing because i'm cowardly and inadequate It feels like every day I consider killing myself. 

At school I have several projects due that I haven't even started yet. Oh and I also have a major test that I haven't studied for. Why? My own fucking laziness. I'm scared that i'll never amount to anything and I consider suicide but then I feel like a coward and i feel even worse. It's like i'm in this weird cycle of wanting to kill myself and then feeling guilty and pathetic because it would hurt my immediate family if I actually went through with it. 

Then again I will just be a disappointment to them if I decide to keep living. Someday's I have no motivation whatsoever, yet for some reason I force myself to keep going to school even though i'm just a waste of space there. My mediocre ""life"" is falling apart before my eyes. I just want my life to be over. I'm running out of reasons to live. I'll probably kill myself before the year is even over.

Wesfilly,5esc4x,1480057609,Each day I'm getting more and more ready to commit.,"I was a spoiled child. I'd usually get what I asked for. I was able to avoid uncomfortable acts like chores and get straight to enjoyable things that wasted my time. I was somehow innately smart enough to get straight B's in all subjects without putting in effort.

Then came the next level of education, and I was unprepared for the amount of effort required. I had not learned to really get hurting to succeed, like an athlete would when they're running on the treadmill trying to go further. Many around me had this grit, this ability to put up with bullshit to get what they want. I just flaked, and came out with no grades.

That was 6 years ago. I knew then I wouldn't be seeing university. I would have to find a job and hope it went somewhere. 

After a year or so I had become depressed. I was sent by others to my doctor, to a therapist. After some time I was sending myself. I've had the support of a wealth of doctors, psychiatrists, therapists, psychologists, voluntary organisations, friends, family and employers. 

After every intervention it's the same: I feel better for a short while then fall right back into realising just how bullshit everything is, and I still don't have that grit needed to face the bullshit. 

After all of this I can see that there's no cure for pain or even a treatment, and to some extent I just have to man up if I want to get somewhere in life like out of my parents' house. Sure medication can change some feelings and therapy can help put things into a structure, but none of it will prepare me for the inevitable pain of the marathon ahead. 

I've learned that to get by you have to be willing to take the pain of life. You have to commit. I'm not willing, but there's another choice that takes just as much commitment and is just as frightening: the commitment to throw it all away forever. In this I don't get any pain, that's for the people around me who care about me. Every day that passes I feel more ready to commit. I have my plans, I can visualise them, I just need to do it."

cammissar,5bli4l,1478515276,"I hate this quote, it's one of the highest rated posts on this sub: Nothing drives people crazier than seeing someone have a good fucking life."," A lot of people are just fine and I don't think they deserve it 

All I think about these days is how everyone who's fucked me over is fine. They're all easily able to have normal lives and function in society. A few women I've met have told me about molesters and rapists targeting them, I either know these people personally or can look them up online and they're all fine. They don't care about anything they put me or my friends through. The truth is that all of the people who have good fucking lives are bad fucking people. Everyone it drives crazy is a victim who never gets over it.

It certainly drives me crazy. The quote is not wrong and that is the problem. Only these terrible fucking people are the ones who can sleep easy have good fucking lives. They'll never care unless it's beaten into them and at that point why even bother because it might be difficult to get away with. And by why bother I mean that at this point I might as well get back at one person and then die. Am I wrong? I don't feel wrong.

I've pretty much given up on being able to function properly.  Every attempt to seek help ends up me being fucked over like manipulated by family or involuntarily held at hospitals.  When I was a kid it felt like every decision was taken away from me and everything was decided for me and done terribly.  Can't do anything about it because no matter how good I can make anything now, it's not like none of that ever happened.  You can't undo any of this, and if that's the case then why bother.

If I don't kill myself then I might live long enough to make it all worthwhile for someone who doesn't deserve to feel comfortable."

I had really deep feelings for her at one point, and we live very far away from each other. These days we haven't been hanging out much, and it seems like we only hang out when she wants to, and she doesn't seem to care if I do or not. She has the time to, but doesn't. I've been having issues with suicidal thoughts and depression. She doesn't even need to try to upset me, because she's actually very nice, but I've nearly attempted suicide numerous times and jumped to writing suicide notes over this girl. Is it best that I say goodbye and cut her out completely?

What I left out is that when I jump to conclusion and write suicide notes, I also sometimes, put belts around my neck, put plastic bags over my head, search medicine cabinets, and consider taking the subway downtown and jumping off of a building I can get access to. Sometimes I consider jumping in front of a train. I can't this any more if I'm not important to her.

What do I do?"
mikupikachu,5chdbh,1478903758,What's the point of going on in life,"Ever since the beginning of last month, my life has completely gone down the drain. My best friend/crush stopped talking to me, my friends are always fighting and bullying others (including me), my grades are falling, and pretty much all supportive people in my life have been drifting away from me. Overall, things have gotten pretty bad. But in all honesty, my life overall is just as bad. I have autism which makes it almost impossible for people to like me. The majority of people think I'm weird because I sometimes do something really awkward and weird, so people don't want to talk to me. It doesn't help that I'm super shy and sensitive, even the smallest insult can send me into tears. My friends use me to get snacks because they know I won't stand up to them. The only super important person at school (my best friend/crush) hates me now because I made a mistake and now she won't even talk to me. The main reason I'm so depressed right now is because she's so mad. She meant the world to me. I would literally do anything I could just to make her happy and let her know I care about her, but I failed at that. I think about wanting to die daily ever since she got mad. I spend at least an hour a day fantasizing about suicide. She was the only one I trusted, she was so sweet and friendly and kind and wonderful, but then I just had to mess everything up. I don't think I can ever forgive myself (despite the fact what I did was just a mistake (and not THAT bad of one) and she's overreacting a little). My family tells me that life will get better, but I know it won't. It's been a nightmare for around 7 years and I don't think I can handle life anymore. I just want to go into a permanent sleep and never wake up. I don't know what to do anymore so I'm hoping someone will be able to give me advice on how to keep my will to live from breaking completely. I'm only hanging on by a thread of hope that things just might become better."

Almost all of my other cousins (somewhat around my age) have been very successful with relationships and have had at least one that's lasted a year or more. This past Thanksgiving, my cousin (who's several years younger than me and is in a serious relationship herself) even asked me, ""How's the single life going?"", which I feel implies that the general sentiment in my family is that I'm the long-term bachelor type that probably won't be with anyone until later in life.

I'm really not looking forward to hearing people ask, ""Are you seeing anyone? Is it serious? When are you getting engaged?"" as well as frantically asking if my friends/family members know if anyone they know is single and having to explain to dates why I haven't had a serious relationship by my late 20's/30s. And don't get me started on having to learn how to be in a serious relationship if I finally find one in my 30s, which just sounds like plain hell.

I thought college would change all of that. I thought I would be easily able to connect and find other people that would want to hang out with me. I thought starting off presenting full time MtF would solve my social gender dysphoria. I thought I could begin to live my own life separate of my trauma.

But none of that happened. The only groups I stuck with disbanded or don't meet often enough. All my friends but one(girl mentioned in the title) stopped talking to me or inviting me to do anything. I could hide in my hall for days and no one would notice, care, or check up on me.

SeptikHeart,5dx9tr,1479632184,"So, it's not normal to feel bad if your life sucks?","I guess I don't understand depression. I still live my daily life like usual, i still laugh at jokes and enjoy stuff like short video games. The thing is, my life sucks. My vision sucks. I have dissociation which seems like I'm stuck with it and honestly, doesn't even bother me that much anymore but it's definitely worth mentioning. I have brain damage from hitting my head when I was depressed and since then I've felt much better but still feel like my life sucks because, well, it does. I have a bald spot due to getting a mole removed which will always be there. I can't wear contacts cause I have strabismus due to my brain injury so I'm stuck wearing glasses which don't even help that much and weigh a lot due to the prisms that are built in. 

Anyways, ever since my brain injury I have hardly any sympathy for others. People think I'm a dick cause I am blunt about my observations. I call out people for being selfish and, well, people don't like that. I've tried talking to people about this but they don't care until you say you want to kill yourself. Then all of a sudden they care. Due to my brain injury/dissociation I have terrible memory and am constantly losing things. Looking at my life logically, there is no reason to continue living like this. If someone had a brain injury 1000 years ago they would be left to die. There's no point to live through a disability. Yes, I know people live through disabilities all the time but for what? I literally day dream through the majority of my life. I won't remember writing this tomorrow. I called a suicide help line and their hope was that a miracle drug will be able to reverse brain injury in the future. Sure, that's possible but in the meantime I'm wasting valuable time accomplishing nothing due to the state I'm in. Also, there's no guarantee that they will actually be able to find something that reverses brain injury. I sleep for 12 hours at a time regardless of how tired I am due to my brain injury so I end up with not as much time in the day as other people.


Anyways, it's not like any of you care about me or my problems. They're not fixable. In fact, I would think that in a state with legal assisted suicide that I'd be able to fit their standards. "

But I figured someone, anyone should know my story.
Hi, I'm Jonas. I'm some 16 year old high schooler who has recently lost all direction in life. I've spent the past 16 years with loving grandparents and a ruffled past between my parents. Sorry, turbulent would be more adequate. I realized my suicidal tendencies around 4th or 5th grade, when I got the notion that my mom cared more about my grades than my happiness (yes, I come from an Asian family). Every year we go on these trivial family vacation trips that I never want to go to. I'm not anti-social, but spending money on hotels seems like a huge waste of money, when I have no problem with simply staying at home.
I'm sorry for going off topic but this background is important for what follows. My mom is in a constantly tipsy-turvy financial situation, and her stress and depression translates out of nowhere at times to myself and my little brother. Seeing my little brother endure the same torment that I have been through in the past ten or so years of my life, replayed before my very eyes. I have tried comforting him in the face of her chastising him, her calling us useless hobos who won't ever get a job, her facade of being nice and kind and gentle to us, and anyone that hasn't been her child wouldn't know how utterly bullshit that is. All I want is to be in the custody of my father or my paternal grandparents, since my maternal grandparents would back her point of view that grades make the world go round and kids are only a source of financial advancement. Obviously that dream is hopeless now, with 2 years only to fix this mess.
All in all, the pressure of highschool AP courses, and education has crushed me. I've been turned down by 14 girls since I was 10, i'm currently seeking companionship and appreciation in the face of a declining relationship with my mother, and for all I know, my days are numbered. My longtime crush has recently turned ship and headed towards another individual. The imagery and visualization of throwing myself down the stairs, hanging myself, throwing myself into a bus have become more and more vivid every time I get lectured by my mom, my closest friends are too far away to physically comfort me, and the thing I need the most is for someone to physically comfort me right now. I know this feeling will go away, shrouding itself in the daily movements, but I want this here, to remind me that I need to deal with this and remove myself from negative situations. I need this here for people to see me for who I really am. Not a happy gamer boy that's just never lucky, but a downtrodden, broken, shattered personality embodying a husk. I'm tired, i'm in tears, and I thank you so much for taking the time to read this.
I shall finish this with what I began with: I am not suicidal. I'm playing a game of brinkmanship with the devil."

MelancholySymphony,5dfiwx,1479385729,"I'm moments away, almost ready. First timer.","I don't have time for much of a back story but I've always had something inside me ever since I can remember. Something in the deepest recesses of my psyche that has always felt inadequate and inferior to everyone around me. A profound unworthiness for the love I've received in my life and the advantages in life that I was born into.

I grew up in a close and happy family. We were certainly quite well off as my father was the boss of a very large multinational, multi-billion dollar company for 25  years. So I honestly can't say that I can really pinpoint any specific major traumas and the like. I've always known that I was incredibly lucky to have the upbringing and opportunities that so many people never have. But I just never felt worthy. At almost every single turning point in my life, I feel like I've always made the wrong choice, even when many of those choices resulted in what most people would consider success or achievement. Money and the thinly veiled illusion status and all that goes with that.

Fast forward to why I'm here now. Over the last few years, my whole world has been slowly unraveling. I've lost so much. The money and the material things that we allow to come to define us were the first to go, but they were by far the easiest to let go of. I started a business with my father (he came out of retirement) and things were going really well until shit really hit the proverbial fan. Every single possible thing, whether in our control or not, went wrong. Costing ungodly amounts of cash on a weekly basis. My father kept the full scale of the seriousness of the situation we were in from me. He had the true set of accounts and I didn't have anythjng so truthful and accurate as he did. He later explained to me that at the time he thought he was protecting me from the worst but it took its toll on him mentally and physically. I witnessed thus decline first hand, 6 data a week. We ended up losing it all. It was too late by the time I got to bottom of what was truly going on to do anything about it.

I can say with the utmost honesty that it wasn't about the money, the perceived shame of finding ourselves in a perfect storm in which we had no chance. It was about knowing that my father and my mother worked very hard most of my life. My sister and I were often casualties of working parents. I rarely saw my father in my formative years, it was only when he retired that I truly started to get to know him. Everything he did, he did for my sister and I. He knew what he was giving up to do the job he had to do to give us the best life he could. 

Just as I was developing an incredibly strong bond with him, we lost it all. He lost it all. When I say all, I mean everything. He's never been the same and it absolutely broke my soul to realise that it was all for naught. All the time away and so many other things.

At the same time, I lost my best friend since I was 6 years old to a relentless form of brain cancer. It broke him. He was the strongest person I ever knew and my  final memories of him were horrific and they were burned into my being.

My mother had a freak car accident and became severely physically disabled and it brought on early onset dementia , which runs in the women in our family. We had no money or resources to put towards improving her quality of life and extending it. My father blamed himself. She was as poised and graceful on her way our as she had lived her whole life despite the injuries and her slowly losing her grip on reality which she was so acutely aware of.

I was weak and I turned to substances to escape. I was the strong one keeping the family together. I had to man up and put the brave face on but it took its toll. I could never show weakness, I couldn't share my pain, my sorrow. I had to bottle it up and keep it to myself to be strong for everyone. As is typical, the drugs worked for a little while but then they became the problem not the escape. 

I've since given all of the crap up and things are much more stable than they've been for many years. However, t he combination of the repressed emotions and the substance abuse has left me emotionally numb. To go with my deep sense of worthlessness.

I've said enough. I'm sitting in my car 50 metres from a very large body of water and I'm almost ready. 

This, I suppose, is my last ditch effort to find a reason and a way not to end up in that water tonight.  If there is anybody out there, I'm just holding on but I'm not sure how much longer I'm going to last. I feel hopeless, broken, without any options in life because of this depressed suicidal state I've fallen into.

There's a part of me that's still holding on. Help."
COsuicide,5duox4,1479591385,I know this isn't technically the right sub for this,"Ok, so I think I'm going to end it. I guess I'm not really looking for someone to convince me to stop. It's just that I've made several attempts in the past, and they all failed. Mainly due to the fact that they weren't well thought out. Done mostly on a whim and sometimes while drunk. How I tried really isn't all that important. The point is, if I do it again I want it to work. I have a really good plan this time, but I need to make sure I have all the bases covered. I need a second opinion and I have no idea where to go to get one.

Again, I'm not really looking for someone to talk me down about how life can get better and potential to be happy and all that. As Marcus Aurelius said, in giving up life we forfeit nothing. All anyone ever has to lose is the present. Whether they are 2 or 92. When anyone dies they lose the only thing we have, the present. So no, it's not a tragedy, it's not a loss. I will give up my present one day either way, so why not sooner when I'm living in a hostel environment, one that does not suit my brain?

Anyway, someone please pm me and we can talk more about it.   "

change1245,5f6w2d,1480273676,12 hours to make decisions,"I'm going to be going back to college later tonight, though I'm reluctant about doing so. The student part of me wants me to just go back to school and be ready for class on Monday, but the other part of me feels that I'm going to feel more overwhelmed than I can handle.

Campus police have been rather rough with me, in my opinion, to say the least. I have chronic depression and/or possibly other mental disorders. I don't want to go back to campus because it sets off a lot of mental triggers in my mind. Certain locations or sounds trigger me. I tend to panic whenever I hear walky-talkies because I feel like campus police are after me, even if the walky-talkies I hear are only from custodians or other staff. I avoid sleeping on the left side of my head because campus police tackled me down to bring me to a mental hospital and I hit the left side of my head on the concrete fairly hard. I still have bruises/scars from that incident even though it was awhile ago. Laying down and having pressure on that part of my head just causes me to visually and audibly play out that event in my head.

I'm not quite fond of the police department at my school due to those events as well as other events. If I go back to campus, I don't want to die or commit suicide there. I just don't like the idea of campus police poking around my corpse. But I don't really want to die, and I don't want to drop out of college or take medical leave either especially near the end of the academic term. I just want to actually enjoy my college experience and life in general.

I don't even have a full day to know what to do. I'm considering writing wills and suicide notes just in case because I just don't know how things will play out."
notattachedtoworld,5eieyt,1479921165,I just need a bit of support to get through this mess.,"To start it off..the odds are I am not gonna hurt myself. Just..I don't know where I could rant about it, since it really isn't something that would fit on /r/depression or some kind of similar

My mother's a fucking alcoholic. She went through a rehab and even was in jail for a few months(she crashed a car while she was drunk). She goes through phases of being totally okay and phases of being shitfaced 24/7. When she's in that shitfaced phase, everything, every single fucking thing, goes wrong.

My grandparents, especially grandfather..they are amazing people. If it wasn't for them, we would be homeless. They own the flat we live in and pay taxes for her. And I hate lying to them about everything being okay. But mother has put them through so many problems that I always feel like I was the one who let down when I see how worried they get when I tell them about something going wrong. As I also feel extremely uncomfortable about talking too much(in this kind of situation) and having to go through all that extreme stress and fear of what's going to happen(only one year left for me before I can go to psychologist on my own, yay. Maybe I'll get some anxiety prescription pills, it's getting worse with time)

Today, when I went to school at 5 p.m., it was the first time in this week that I talked with her when she wasn't drunk. She arrived with her 'friends'(they are her friends, but they are basically homeless people, alcoholics and all that stuff) and only as some kind of annoying thing to do, she said 'eh, happy birthday by the way.' It wasn't until she at least somehow got a bit sober when she realized that it's my birthday. Also, when I got home, it smelled like the worst pubs in the world do. Cigarettes, cheap alcohol, fried food with LOTS of oil. Just total shit.

There's a big chance that it's gonna kill her. She's been at hospital because of that last year, the alcohol totally destroyed her pancreas. Sometimes she has seizures, so that makes for even bigger risks.

But honestly..no matter how selfish I'm gonna sound, I wouldn't probably mind that much. It feels, especially during these shitfaced periods, that she is already gone and this is only some kind of 'zombie' living in her shell.

You may ask what my father does about that. Nothing. Not that he doesn't want to, but my mother divorced with him ten years ago. We(me and my brother) see him every other week, when he arrives. I think that we can all agree that it's very little time for us(eight hours each month), but it's totally worth it. Time spent with my father is probably one of the most beautiful things I get to live through. He also has a family of his own now and his business is in a bad state now, so he's already in stress now.

Don't get me wrong, I don't hate her. It's just that I hate this person, this stupid fucking alcoholic piece of shit that ruins both my and brother's life. Sometimes I do wish she died though..not because I don't want to see her anymore, but because it would already be over, you know? No more stress, no more fears, no more thoughts like 'what if she gets totally crazy(she almost killed her boyfriend once, like literally) and does something to me or my brother?'. I would miss her normal self, but in times like this it's gone anyway. 

Both me and my brother love music, so we kind of help ourselves with this little joke 'no good musician had simple and fun life'. It inspires me when I'm writing lyrics and my brother when he's composing music(sometimes it's the other way around, but most of the time it's like this). Beside that, there's probably no good. Beside me more appreciating my close friends, probably.

I thought I was ready for him to hate me, but I wasn't. 

He talks shit about me to his friends on Xbox, and he makes mean comments to me occasionally so he can shift the blame onto me for being ""mean"" to him instead of taking accountability for his actions. I am now the ""bad guy"" in his eyes, even though I know that he is being unreasonable, it still hurts like hell. Spending another moment in the house with him feels impossible, but I need to. He makes me feel like I am a piece of shit for wanting my money back. I don't have the inner strength to combat personal attacks, no matter how unjustified they are.

Not a day goes by where I dont think about the shitty fucking disgrace I am. Im 16 right now. If I dont die before 20 I'll finish it myself. My future will not be good. Whats the point of living a life I wont like? Death seems like such a relief. Nothing to worry about, no stress, no nothing. I understand that I'll never experience happiness or something that I like but Im willing to take that risk. Enduring all embarassing shit isnt worth it. The only thing keeping me from getting drugs is my girlfriend. I no longer care about my family. We probably wont last for long so when were over Im gonna find something and take it. Hopefully it'll kill me but doubt on that. Maybe I'll get a terminal dissease. Then I'll be able to die without dissapointing anyone. 




I've become a terrible human being in the last 8 months. Whenever someone feels bad and jokes about taking their life I just think ""alright"". When going through this sub all I can think of is ""I wish I had the courage to do it too"". I dont even deserve to live. I wish my parents aborted me.

warface25,5bqytt,1478576073,[17m] I had a breif moment of clarity in depression and constant suicidal thoughts.,"So i was walking home from the gym at night. It was close to 10:00, it was a bit foggy, but the sky was totally clear as far as the eye could see. The moon shone brightly in the sky. It was almost bitterly cold (because I live in Canada), but I didn't care at the moment. I was walking past my local park and I had a sudden urge to go on the swings. ""Well nobodys around so why not"" I thought to myself. I walked up the hill and sat on the swing there. It was cold and damp because of condesation I guess. I was the only person there. Just as well since I cam be insecure sometimes. My favourite song ""Starman"" by David Bowie was playing in my earbuds while I swung. The main chorus ""Theres a starman waiting in the sky"" came on and I sung it outloud, not caring what anyone might think if they saw me. My entire body tingled with a strange sensation that knew I had not felt in long time. Joy? Innocence? I'm really not sure but it felt amazing. At that moment I didn't care about the courses I was falling behind in, that the girl I had a crush on would never notice me, and that I might not get into college. I was carefree. The feeling did not last however. My depression inducing thoughts soon returned. So I got off the swing and walked off alone, back into the darkness."

I look at the world and see that I never wanted to be here. I didn't choose to love where I do or when I do. I didn't choose what are meant to be life goals for a person. I feel like I'm trapped just being in this world.

I've talked to my family and everything but the thing is I don't really know of o want to get any better. I can take medicine but then what the fuck am I but a person living with a shroud over what really concerns me. 

I feel like the most sober I ever am is when I'm thinking in a state of mind that is negative. I can go months at a time where I feel good and don't think about being sad, but when it comes down to it, thoughts like those are what exist deep in me. They are my core values. I don't have a religion or anything, just what I believe is wrong or right. 

I know that I shouldn't be upset and should try to better myself but what's the fucking point. No matter what I try to do I'm just treading water. I say that since this life is the only one we're given, I should try to make the most positive impact that I can, or just experience the most things that I can, but either way I'm just filling my life with stuff.

That I should kill myself. Maybe it's because we've all heard since we were young that psychopaths are innately murdering, child-raping machines, maybe it's a reflection of what I actually think about myself.

TheUnknownPosts,5f3xk5,1480226063,Perfection gone to infection.,"Me

Sometimes I just sit and regret everything. I just want a break away from my life, but a lot of people really love and care about me. I'm not the kind of guy that anyone would suspect anything from. I'm always making people laugh, always happy, always fun to be around. I have so many friends. They all love me a lot, but I don't really care anymore. Let me give you an outlook of who I am- I'm a very smart honor roll student, very flamboyant, people find me to be very attractive, and I have the best, best friend in the world! We always talk and she always tells me how great I am and funny. Yet, I feel strong regret and sorrow. I've just been feeling lately that I should give up. My mom and dad are the best ever. I have a seemingly perfect life. I just got off my amazing vacation for thanksgiving and some people even call me rich but trust me, I'm not, and that's what I tell them.

Dating

(I'm bisexual and closeted, and before you go and tell me that I'm probably in denial, I know for a fact. I'm 100% sure.) During school, my guy crush started touching up my leg, but I had the immediate reaction just to call him out to everybody at the table, and I've immediately regretted it and I just cannot stop obsessing over it! The same thing happened to my lady crush but was WAY more public. She started texting me on Instagram about how she felt and I immediately ratted her out. She wanted to show some affection and I rejected her, but I don't know why! It's exactly what I wanted.

Anxiety

I think I'm dealing with some social anxiety. I've started noticing a week or two ago, but it's hard to deal with. Like sometimes after laughing I just somehow almost start crying, and I can't even eat at lunch anymore because I just feel like everyone's staring at me, and this is not like me at all. The only way to get past it is to try to completely clear my mind which has worked sometimes but is definitely not a permanent fix. People have definitely noticed but only a few have commented on to which I replied with allergies.

closeyoureyeskid,5eyjce,1480147643,Hiya,"

To preface, I know you guys probably have to deal with this a lot and I'm sorry. 

Hi. I am a fourteen year old male named B. I don't really know how to start off so I'll just let my thoughts spill out onto the keys. 

From what I can tell, depression is in my blood. My uncle successfully killed himself, and I know my mother has attempted suicide at least once. The last time I saw my dad was when I was two days old. I never had the opportunity to talk to or see him and I didn't really care to. When I was 11, my mother came into my room, sat down on my bed and flat out told me he died a little while ago. She claimed it was a car crash, but I'm not so sure I believe it anymore. I could always ask his parents but I'm not sure I would like to bring the topic of their son's death up with them. 

It's kinda like kicking me when I'm down, knowing that I was genetically destined to suffer from depression. I can make up excuses for why I feel this way, but it'll always be because of who I am. 

My family situation is complicated. My mother tries to fulfill her life with love and it never works. She has had four children with four different men. The first, A lives with his dad in another state. He's four years older than me and coincidentally I haven't spoken to him in four years. I am the second child. I live with the third and his father because my own is dead and my mother can't support me anymore. She alone lives with the fourth child, S. 

This seems like it didn't really matter but I had to explain before I told you that my only real joy in life is S. He's turning two years old in three days. I was there for his entire life until Mom dumped me with my brother's dad because she can only work part time jobs while looking after S. When he was an infant I would hold him and feed him and lull him to sleep. I was there for his first steps and his first words. I cared about him more deeply than anyone else and loved him in a way that I don't feel for any other family members. I was the happiest I had ever been and maybe will ever be. This time in my life ended when her last boyfriend and the father of S decided he didn't love her anymore. The only person that would take me is J (third child) 's dad. I don't get to see S anymore because mom lives in another state with him.

This sounds horrible but I hate her for it. I blame my mom for abandoning me and taking S with her. I have no one now. No one that I trust can enough to talk to about the way I'm hurting. Nothing to look forward to but sleep.I have friends because I've always been the outgoing type but I don't like any of them. They're only there so I don't look like a loser at school. 

My eyes sting from tears and the bright light of my phone in my eyes at 3am. I won't kill myself tonight but I know in my heart that I'll try soon and it sure as hell won't be a half assed attempt like overdosing on Tylenol. 

If anyone reads this, they'll tell me to reach out to someone close to me, but there is no one close to me. I don't want to talk to anyone around me because I'm afraid that they'll laugh or think I'm weak.

I've never really been religious but I hope my dad's somewhere up there watching me. 

Thanks for the time you took to read my unorganized list of thoughts. 

B

Rogers_Apple,5b53df,1478282224,I'm sick of the cycle...,"I come back to suicide watch every year or so. It's always the same shit; I get depressed, nobody cares, get suicidal and start posting morbid stuff online, people flip a shit. It's like this every single fucking time, and nothing changes.  

Nobody seems to care about me before I start feeling suicidal, and that's only because we live in a society that hates the idea of ending one's own life, yet doesn't seem to care about those who are depressed, until of course, they start taking it to the next level.  

I wish I were a girl. Depressed girls get infinitely more support than depressed men, this is a fact. The reason is because women tend to be more empathetic and so having female friends leads to more support for whatever problems you're experiencing and women tend to have more female friends than males, whereas my male friends just laugh at me and tell me to do a flip while blowing my brains out... it's funny, but it doesn't really help.  

No girl I like seems to want to deal with me; I'm too nice, too crazy, too shy, too introverted. I'm a virgin, I'm weird, I'm lonely as fucking fuck and it's killing me.

Grammar is not my thing, i'm from elsewhere 21/M

Well I knew that my life is going to be horrible since seven years old, my father was alcoholic, constant fear in home, constant emotional bashing definitely didn't help me to man up, it made me worse, it made me not who I should be, tho i'm not blaming my father, i'm blaming myself, I am not able to express my feelings in anyway apart from anger and jealousy.You wanna know what the funniest thing is, I dropped out of high-school, never finished it, just couldn't cope up with other people.I was bullied, you know that feeling when someone just pushes you over and over and you are about to explode ? I smashed that guy's face into a brick wall and strangled him - scared the shit out of him, he ran away, I got my point across, he never told a word to anyone, it made me at ease to finally get on with my life and try harder, but I just couldn't do it, shit I was even bullied by teachers, subtle just the way they do, to motivate normal people, well that didn't help, it pushed me into a hole, everyday was a struggle and it still is.Tried to end it all four times now, i'm having some fucked up dreams too, so I just sit here in front of this screen and slowly rot.

When I look back over my life, heh , I laugh, I laugh so hard, it's all a big joke, and i'm the one who's on the stage about to ? choke

BML8384,5bh159,1478455209,Passed the Pain Threshold- Time to Die,"There is only so much you can take and I have had enough.

They say wait three days before you take action- I've waited 3 months and feel surer than ever.

A woman told me my Life has no joy and she was right- it's just a series of problems and defeats.

Severas years ago my Mother died and as my main emotional support it left me very alone. No close family; I have friends but recently have really withdrawn from them.
A girl whose affections I declined at my previous work (I'd had a previous bad experience getting involved with a colleague) made my Life Hell and I had to leave.

But I fought back, got back into a good paying enjoyable Government job with a manager who really likes me (he interviewed me) and managers, colleagues, canteen staff and even the cleaners seem to like me.

But how it all has went wrong sums up my life.

When I started a much younger girl, call her M, made it very clear she was interested and acted up around me, glancing, smiling, exaggerated behaviour, the works. much as I liked this my previous experience at work made me keep my distance and, TBH, her prettiness and perkyness intimidated me a little. So I avoided interaction for a few months.

You can probably guess where this is going: I ended up working beside her and after a few awkward days we got talking and got on very well- similar tastes in Art &amp; Literature and we recommended things to each other. She was seeing someone else at work for a month before I arrived.
And I developed a crush.

Shortly after I was going though another dark period and took a month off with depression- being told she was leaving didn't help. I ended up back on medication and returned.
Turns out she hadn't moved (office mix up) but was moving in with her boyfriend. Things somehow lost the momentum and we went back to being slightly awkward with each other. Not in a bad way, just that somehow it felt odd, and a little forced.
I came in one day and we both looked at each other and.. 'startled'? It was just..odd. she said hello, I said hello and we walked on. It was genuinely strange and hard to explain. We never spoke again as shortlyn after she went to train others.

And the medication doesn't stop the feelings of pointlessness in my life. 

I managed to import N. via the Internet as I spent a lot of my time off researching how to exit this life.

So to cut a long story short a office reshuffle means she is moving now, and what happened Friday really affected my self image.

At the end of the day (I'm usually last to leave) she came back up, probably to check her desk items had been moved, and was saying her flamboyant goodbyes to the last two managers left. I was coming out of the kitchen and asked her how she enjoyed the training; she simply said 'great', didn't make eye contact or even stop walking whilst focusing on the other two.

I left about five minutes later as she was standing at another door 30 yards away on her phone, waiting probably on her boyfriend.
She looked up, saw me, turned her back and continued texting.

And that's when I realised- I've become a sad middle aged creeper. That odd guy who unnerves younger women. Really pathetic and sad.

I said nothing and just walked on as I didn't want to upset her in any way. She'd said enough without a word.

And it's made me realise the state my life is in- it's disastrous on relationships. My best female friend offered me a 'friends with benefits' situation. She is fun, attractive and Sexy but I know it's because she feels she can't get better.

So I repulse younger women and incite pity in older ones.

This weekend has been joyless and I see only one way out. Thank God I got the N- I just need some peach as at 46 I just can't cope with this terrible hopeless position.ī"

I've learned to surround myself with people who wouldn't judge or criticize me even for my own good. I stopped talking to a lot of my family but they didn't want anything to do with myself or my dad and siblings anyway. I've wanted to die for more than 13 years. I'm really really tired. The only thing that would drive me when I was younger was thinking eventually I could support myself making artwork and music or just creating. As much as it's the only emotional outlet I have left I realize how pointless it is without already being wealthy. I work retail. I will never afford an education. Taking loans is suicide anyway.  I hate myself and I'm fully aware of the deep resentment most people feel for the fact that myself and people like me exist. I am going to kill myself eventually because I can't possibly live in the us being who I am. Escapism was really the last thing I had left.

uvtool,5ejtrl,1479935922,"Why do people think ""what's the point of going on"" is a rhetorical question? What's the payoff for this repetitive maddening grind?","I just hit the seven month mark with my current job, the longest I've ever been able to tolerate the same place day in and day out. I don't know how I can make it another five months, much less any longer. It's just working so I can barely afford to have a place to sleep and food to eat to keep me going to work another day. What is it for? Of the eight waking hours I'm not at work, a half hour goes toward getting ready for work, two are spent commuting (I can't afford to live any closer), another hour spent cooking and cleaning up the dishes (Recently started trying to cook healthier meals after I started shitting blood from too much fast food, since those are the only options near my office). The rest goes to grocery shopping or cleaning or other chores and errands.


So do I sacrifice five days a week so I can enjoy the weekend? Because almost every weekend I'm too drained or tired to enjoy anything. I usually wake up around 9 a.m. Saturday and lie in bed awake until around 1 or 2 p.m. and force myself to get up and find something to distract myself with.


If those five days of shit are just for one measly, shitty weekend, then that's a terrible deal. 



Every work day I wake up and feel this overwhelming sense of insanity at doing the same thing again, and when I realize I probably have 50 more years of this shit, I get that sensation you get when you look down at the ground from a great height. 


I have nobody in my life. I haven't had a friend since college. I occasionally call my parents, but it's too tiring to pretend I'm normal. 


I made a shit choice in major and will probably never make more than barely above minimum wage. 


I am tired all the time. It doesn't matter how much sleep I get, it feels like I didn't get any at all. I struggle to stay awake at work and home. Until last month, I had adderall to at least give me a little energy. Then I turned 26 and could no longer use my father's health insurance plan. 


Seriously, why do I keep going on? That's not a rhetorical question, I want to know why. I think the only reason I haven't killed myself is because it's hard to overcome the biological impulse to survive that evolution has programmed into us. 



People say wanting to die is irrational, but I really think it's the other way around. There's nothing rational about wanting to go on when you hate your life, it's just a trick your brain plays on you.

To be fair, in retrospect of putting this together this is basically a vent too but honestly I've never felt so ready to just let go. Probably not even through an actual deliberate attempt but sort of just letting general health and wellbeing go. Does that still even count, should I even post here? Fuck knows.

This year has been killing me from start to finish.

The day David Bowie died, and I so wish it was just the day David Bowie died, one of my best friends passed away from a brain aneurysm. I don't know if he saw me as anything more than just the at the time 17 year old who came in to fill cylinders off a compressor all day, but through any doubts at work it's him that kept me there. He was the one thing that motivated me to get to the point I'm at now, where I was signed off as a professional just before coming to uni.

I struggled with A levels and with trying to keep my emotions in check up until I left my sixth form college. I thought I'd made it. I got into my university of choice, I had finally pushed through, from there it can only get better.

I was wrong. I was so wrong because it turns out people who are scared of being surrounded by new people aren't too good at moving in or going on nights out with the people they're living with.

I got past it, I made friends with my 6 flatmates, this is it, I can get on with all the good things to come.

In the last week, a friend from school jumped in front of a train and ended her own life. I was one of the people to physically prevent her from jumping off a bridge and I thought after the police took her in and took care of her and sent her to hospital, it would be fine. She seemed happy, she had made plans for the future. In the same week, my brother was in a car accident. He's fine now and if he wasn't i don't think I'd have been able to take it. I had my midterm exam for research methods and data analysis I today. It's been a tough week but I gave it everything I had and I just so hope it was enough, I should get results soon I think. And now, a friend who came here with me, who I have asked nothing of but money to cover printing ink costs (that their parents gave to them with the intention of giving to me) has decided that I'm not worth the money, and has given me a long list of things out of the blue that are bad about me. I defended myself on each point given after it was all out and all I got was ""Okay, we're done now"". With this goes my housing arrangements for next year and probably almost all of my other friends here, as well as some of my closest friends from back home.

I have never felt so alone.

I've tried to get help for my problems and it's still not working. I'm trying to be better so people will stop hating me and leaving me and it's not working. Nothing is working.

I can't help but feel it's never going to stop. It's not just been this year, it seems like every year is a new set of tragic events with somebody being killed or deciding I'm not worth the trouble of keeping around.

This year was meant to be the year I got better. I got to uni and decided to start making positive changes and it seems like there's just barrier after barrier in my way.

I just don't know what to do. It seems like the more or louder I ask for help the more it gets thrown back at me worse. Maybe I'm better off being alone because at least it isn't taken away every so often.

Maybe I'm not. Maybe I should stop trying to work things out. It'd be a weird sort of interesting to see what happens if i just let it all unravel, see how long I can make it last.

Maybe I should stop trying to do anything. I just don't know anymore. All I can see is that I'm left alone. It doesn't matter what happens.

This is what my thoughts and feelings are. I'm not proud of it, fuck I'm doing psychology at undergrad level, I should know better. But it's there. It is how it is. I don't know what I'm even typing anymore, so fuck it, that's all I got."

I'm an overweight adult living in my parents' basement. I've never had a relationship. I sit around playing video games, watching YouTube, and eating during my free time. I work maybe 12 hours a week if I'm lucky at a tiny little redneck small town speck of a grocery store and get paid minimum wage. I just feel like I'm further degrading myself for all our customers' benefit. I have no skills. I only have $300 in my savings account and my checking account is negative because, as I already said, my job is complete shit and I blow all my money on stupid shit I don't need to try to make myself feel better for a short period of time and I have nothing I need money for since I live with my parents and there's nothing I want enough to make myself save up for it. And then I just feel guilty about it. My parents are pressuring me to go to college. Lol. Forget it. I'm broke as fuck and I don't even want to go. There is no sort of career field I'm even remotely interested in. I would just be even more miserable and I would feel like I was doing it for them, not me, anyway. I have no friends. No one wants to hang out with me because I'm ""weird"" and ""annoying."" I have no social skills whatsoever, never have. I have no purpose and no direction. My entire existance is meaningless and I have no desire to turn it around. I'm so lazy I don't even feel like bettering myself. So fuck it. I'd be better off dead. I'd rather be dead.

Cragilbe94,5dk2i6,1479436719,My life. The loser.,"In my whole 22 years of life I've never felt ""normal."" Ever since I can remember I've always been an anxious and depressed person. I would have my moments where I felt some type of joy, but usually that was euphoria from the drugs. I've been to rehab twice in my life already and have been clean for about 4 months now. I'm still not certain with myself. I have a full time job and make decent money without going to collage but I still feel like a failure in life. I could have made my family proud, maybe had a better relationship with my father. 

Everything seems fine on the outside world, but deep inside it's a waging war that never ends. I want to be happy so bad but I can no longer feel any sense of joy. I go about everyday with a fake smile on my face, but deep down I'm constantly nervous something terrible is going to happen. Come night time ""especially during winter season"" I get terrible thoughts in my head. These thoughts basically tell me I'm a loser and could have done better in life. It's come to a point now where suicide  would be the only relief. It almost brings me down knowing that it's always there. How easy it could be to finally just quit life in general. Then comes the sense of selfishness.

I'm sorry Mom and Dad, it was not your fault. It was my own decisions that led me here. Maybe an imbalanced chemical reaction that antidepressants couldn't fix. Just know I dearly loved you and this is something I had to face. I just want to feel some sense of relief again. "

throwaway254689,5ccydd,1478843709,I'm just done,"I was born in 2000. When I was 5-8 my uncle raped and molested me. In 2006 my uncle's brother died and that hurt. My mum's boyfriend cheated on her during this time and I was to young to understand but it hurt seeing him go. Then we moved somewhere between 2007 and 2009. My mum got back together with her ex sometime after we moved. I didn't like him, he was mean and just not very fun to be around. In 2012 my best friend, my cousin, he died and that killed me. I got very depressed a few months later and started cutting. In november I took over 150 pills and the doctors told my mum and family I wasn't going to make it but I somehow did. Also during this time my anger has become a major problem. The walls of my room and the hallway have no dry wall because I have hit and kicked it off. When I wake up in the hospital bed I'm forced to go to a behavioral hospital. The place didn't help and I was still able to cut myself while I was there because I stole a thumb tac. I convinced them I was all good and in less than two weeks I was out. Also during this time I'm struggling with my sexuality and gender. I came out to my friend about being bi and after I got back to school from the behavioral hospital I find out he has told the whole school and he has also lied and said I sent him messages asking to suck his dick. That killed me. In january I started smoking pot and dipping daily until may when school ended. Fast forward to august when school starts back I get seated right next to a group of bullys who bullied me for everything they could. I asked the teacher to move me but he wouldn't so when I got back home I told my mum I wasn't going back. In late 2014 I start playing minecraft and join a server with amazing people, one of those I will not say her name but leave her as K. During this time I've basically been taught that to be respected and treated like a human and not a kid you have to be older than 18. So I lie to her and say I am a 19 year old who rodeos (rodeo being my dream job at the time). Fast forward a few months into 2015 and we've really become friends, there is also M in the mix. In june we started talking on the minecraft server's forum page and in july we added eachother on facebook. We instanntly hit off and were best friends. Fast forward to around october/november I've started feeling depressed and suicidal again since june but it was nothing big until now. I feel horrible and shitty and guilty for lying to her about who I am so I tell her I feel suicidal. She calls me through facebook and tells me she cares about, she loves me (as a friend) and she will always be there for me. Fast forward to Januray I confess I've lied to her. She is shocked and I'm scared our friendship is over. If it was over I would have killed myself because I would have been alone and at the time that was my biggest fear. Fast forward to September/October 2016 after months of us drifting apart I say something about it. She say's it's because I lied to her and we most likely will never be close friends again because she has moved on. It's understandable but I'm devasted. (I forgot to add sometime between july and september 2016 I tried to commit suicide twice by hanging myself). I posted on reddit and this guy messaged me. We became friends and then in late October after a lot of sexual frustration between us we sent nudes. I felt horrible, I felt like I did when my uncle raped and molested me and I didn't message him back for weeks. I told him I would explain when I could which was almost 2 weeks ago. Me and K are still talking through all of this and late October she messages me saying her exams are almost over and she will be an active friend again and may even come play some minecraft (something we havent done in months as the server we met on has mostly died out due to the owner quitting streaming). I get overwhelmed with excitement. Things start out great, we're messaging quite a bit again. She's actually replying to me for once and not just reading what I say and ignoring it. Then slowly but surely she goes back to her old ways and starts ignoring me again. Fast forward to November 10. today. I can't see myself having a good future. All of my life has been shit. We've been broke for as long as I remember. I have practically no friends at this point. My mums opinion of people who are depressed/bipolar ""we're all a little crazy so just suck it up"" shows that she wont get me help if I tell her I think I might be depressed. My best friend who said she loved me, she cared about me, she'd always be there for me isn't. I keep getting worse and worse and I'm tired of trying everything to be happy and none of it working. I will never be able to afford a sex change. I will never be able to afford university. So what's the point in living if I'll never be happy? I'm just done. I'm done with life, I'm done with trying to be happy. I don't know when or how but I will kill myself before I turn 17 in June 2017 and hopefully sooner so I can quit being a burden. If you've read all of this, thank you. I just needed somebody to listen. "

[deleted],5brce0,1478581130,I just feel bad.,"I don't even know why I am posting here, or why I am using a throwaway. I just usually compartmentalize these feelings inside, as cliche as that sounds. I don't know. I am doing bad from what I can tell in school, and I don't want to. I remember being in elementary school and being fantastically smart, emotionally mature, and a nice person, at least relative to that age. Which I guess really doesn't mean much, considering I was in 6th grade. 

Is this the place to talk about stuff? I feel rude asking that. I don't like confrontation, I despise it. It must've been when I started 7th grade that I turned into the mean-spirited idiot, or self-deprecating egomaniac, it must be. I wish so badly to find out what was that cause, what turned me into this thing I am today. I can't think of why to live is my issue. 

I've talked to a psychiatrist before, and I don't think it really helped. It feels like I am the problem, which must be what a lot of suicidal people feel like. I think it had to do with my childhood, I guess. I think it was the divorce, as fragile as that seems. I remember a few nights ago arguing with my grandmother about reason, and I was desperately trying to show something that I knew, or at least thought, was true. She didn't want to try to understand. Reading that last sentence makes me sound like a terrible person. I guess I am a terrible person. I don't want to be. 

Maybe I'm depressed? Are people just able to slip into this sinking feeling that nags at you during the night? This is horrific. I can't understand. I remember thinking about the future today, and what I wanted to do. Sure, I wanted to become incredibly good at making things, specifically mechanical things, ever since I was a kid playing with legos with the other kids. It just felt so good to me to make those wonderful little machines. I also thought about marriage. I couldn't do that. I couldn't subject a person to me, I was weak, I was frail, I was not good. Even if I was none of those things, I am still so negative as to imply those things about myself. I couldn't put anyone through that, through me. 

I can't imagine a person with the capacity to want to do that, for me. It just doesn't seem realistic or possible in dreams. I am religious, which might be a fault to be or mention, but I was raised in it, then taught about it in a philosophical sense. I loved learning about it and questioning every aspect. I never stood up at our rallies, for those countless times that the speaker for the day said ""come down if you feel not great"". I didn't want to be a burden to other people, especially since it seemed like other people needed help more so. It is my belief that suicide is sinful, as is the death penalty, due to my perhaps ""illogical"" or ""dumb"" beliefs. I can't even remember the several ways our teacher told us to defend against arguments against theism. I vaguely remember the names, the teleological, the ontological, but they hold no reference or subtext to me anymore. I can't remember. 

I want to do better in school, I want to so desperately become a good, moral person who is able to help others, to bring about a greatest good, to bring peace and end hatred. I can't. I don't see purpose, I don't see reason. I feel bounded by my own thoughts, and want the pain to go away. It might just be that I miss what my father was. He is still alive, and I wish him no ill will. I just hope and wish that he remembers his own son's 18th birthday. "

My dad is amazing and he deserves a daughter that isn't so dumb and annoying and helpless. He deserves a daughter who isn't just a giant drain, and I feel so bad. I wish I could apologize to him and my mom and everyone else who has put effort into me. I don't deserve it.

And I know I'm not actually disgusting or a slug, but I still feel awful. I rationally understand and get all the things I think are black and white, and my emotions steam roll me. I just want to lie down on the ground and cry for a really long time and then just fade out of existence. I'm scared of pain.

Okay, so the girl knows I ""like"" her. Do you want to know what she said about me?

My plan is to wait until my children are established in life, when I feel they can handle the loss of losing their mother, and then I will commit suicide. The life insurance money, coupled with a college education and firmly established life skills, will allow my children to escape the generational cycle of poverty, severe abuse, and addiction that I was born into. The cycle will end with me. My life, my suffering, will have not been in vain. Through my children, I will leave the world a better place. &lt;3"

I don't want to whine too much. But, long story short, I've fucked up life. I've gotten to the point where I'm pretty sure I'd be better off just donating all of my organs to people who would make better use of them than me.

The biggest problem in my life is that I seem to have lost the ability to give a damn. I thought about going to a doctor or therapist about it but what would I say? ""Hey Doc, I can't be arsed about anything. Got any pills for that?""

The only reason I haven't jumped off a bridge is because I don't want to hurt my immediate family, who are pretty much the only people who still care about me. But I'm sick of wasting their money just to fail their every expectation. Eventually it's going to come to a head.

Any advice?"

I've been to therapy 6+ years, on antidepressants and still can't seem to find any reason that I should be allowed to exist. I am nothing but a burden to my parents and a failure. They worked so hard to make a better future for my twin sister and me. Well, I can at least take some comfort in knowing that my twin fulfilled their wishes. Why would they need me, a failure of a daughter. I am quite sure that they regret me even being born. Every waking moment I hear my fathers judgmental voice in my head: I am stupid. I will never become anything. I am a mistake.

stixbunny,5ayi3u,1478198194,Nothing will ever get better,"It just won't.

I'm 24. I'm a good person. I've always strived to be a good friend, to study hard, to be the best person I can, but good things have never happened to me. I got into a good uni, 6 year the whole thing, but just couldn't make it. I eventually realised I don't have anything. My friends in school were never good, I got bullied a few times. I think none of them ever remembered my birthday, even until last year, when I posted on their facebook profiles abut theirs. The one good friend I made in uni slowly left for better more popular friends. I failed some classes throughout my stay so I put that on hold to try and get good friends this year. I failed.

I made a good friend while playing videogames, but she had a fair amount of problems. Again, I tried to be the best I could, always offering help and cheering her up. When the time came when I was feeling sad and lonely I never got anything back. Nothing at all. I told her how I fell about it. I had to cut ties with her a few days ago, because I still think I 'll do her more harm than good at this point. I still think of myself as a good person.

I know everything that comes after people know how I feel will be out of pity, rather than something true. I can't believe anyone.

I'm 24, never had a girlfriend or anyone for that matter. I'm not good looking, nor funny and I certainly can't keep up a conversation. The only girl who has ever thought that from me was my mom. How fucking sad is that?

Where I live people don't move out at young age, not until they have a *good* job, which is hard to find. Now me failing my classes and whatnot, I just don't have what it take to work at anything. I just fucking cant.

I tried to get friends, I tried to get a girlfriend, I tried. I really did. But I'm tired, I've done all of the good things and none of it ever came my way. What a piece of shit person I am. Human garbage. The forces that be decided I can't  get anything in life, there's no point in trying anymore. My parents think I'm just doing them no good, but I'm so fucking sick of doing things for others and not getting anything for myself. And I just want to die right now.

I looked up various ways of killing myself. I wont be able to do anything physical that takes time, I know I just won't be able to go through with it. I won't be able to swallow any pills, as I have trouble witth the regulars already.

I'm such a mistake.

Please. I destroyed my life. All of my worst fears came true. I literally don't how I am going to pull through this one. I am very scared.

Ok might as well type out the story. I am very much in love with, share a course with, and live with a monster of a human being. I did everything for him. I genuinely loved him. The only person I ever was in love with. I could have done anything for him. I took all of the shit he threw at me because I believed he was worth it. I believed we could overcome it. I believed the horrible pain he put me through, by lying to me, leading me on, and repeatedly cheating on me, right in front of me, could be worth it. He wasn't always horrible, because if he wasn't, I wouldn't have gotten into this. No. He can be fucking lovely and charming and amazing. Just not to me anymore. A couple of nights ago we got really drunk and he pulled me into a threesome that I don't remember most of, and that I had no desire to participate in at the time. Everyone knows about it. I hear people gossiping. Afterwards he just gave me the cold shoulder. And now he already has a new girl he's dating over. I've been stripped of every last ounce of dignity, lost all of my social circle and now I have to stay here and endure it. If I were to completely remove myself from the situation, as would be logical, I would lose my studies, and literally everything else.  I see no point in starting over. I have nothing to go back to. This was my new life. This was supposed to be me finally being happy. But it's just another level of hell.  
  
He never at any point said he didn't want me. I trusted him like the idiot that I am. We can only communicate when drunk, and then everything seems more or less fine. I negotiated away every last piece of my being just to keep the little that we had. I am ruined. I will never find someone with his qualities (- the complete lack of consideration for my feelings), and I won't be able to settle for anything less. We were actually extremely compatible in every way, in a way that I've never been with anyone else. Now I am embarrassed, broken in every single way, and I see no way forwards. I failed. I wish I wouldn't wake up in the morning."

Although *technically* a plus, they don't hold any intrinsic value. The usefulness is in the action getting done, not in the act.

Compare this to fun people. People who tell jokes or horse around or understand how to really socialize. That's someone who makes memories and forges connections. People are gonna say ""I'm glad I hung out *with x*, whereas for something like me it's ""I'm glad my homework is done"".

Ever since I was a kid, I've been the bullied one. I never understood why. I tried to stand up for myself and fight back, but it never worked. I was extremely depressed throughout middle school and most of high school, but never had the guts to actually kill myself. I just could never get happy, no matter how hard I tried/put my mind to it. 

The main problem, I know, is feeling loved/wanted. I come from a family who always showed a lot of love (except when I talk about my depression - then it's just ""get over it and get out of that mindset). I've always felt love from them, but I've never felt it from anyone else. I have a lot of ""friends"" now that I'm in college, but I've truly never felt so alone. 

It doesn't help that I fall in love easily. I've described myself as a hopeless romantic many times, but I get led on a lot. And I know I'm looking for a girl to fill that void, and it's my fault and the wrong place to look. But I just want someone to love me and tell me I'm worth it. That my life is worth it. 

I've fallen for a girl with a boyfriend. We're actually really good friends, but I'm dying on the inside, because I need to tell her how I feel, but I know I can't handle he rejection right now. It makes me even more depressed than I already am. 

I don't see a future for me. I just see myself getting more and more hurt, living a life alone. And I can't handle that. They say it gets better, but in my 20 years, it hasn't ever gotten better, it just stays worse.

I was getting insecure about my wife's doings on her phone again as she has been in contact with her ex. She sought him out after two years of marriage with me to once again bring up a miscarriage they had together that she neglected to tell him about until a few years ago. This time intimate details come out about how she hadoesn't it and where she buried it. I was OK with her working through this. I was OK to Supportt her in this extreme time of need. I am not enough. She went behind my back and went to her ex before telling me. She lied about conversations lied when I asked her how many times she's called him. She has been texting 50o messages to him in two weeks. Deleting them day by day only offering to show me when the conversation I assume is decent enough to see. I confronted her a tonight and was asked for asked divorce. She claims nothing has happened. She claims I'm projecting my insecurities and I'm at fault for feeling this way. If it weren't for her calling him multiple times before calling me and having numerous late night 1-3am text sessions with her always initiating it I wouldn't feel secure betrayed. But here I sit. At asked friends house restless, pained, and wondering what to do. I don't want to hurt myself again but I can't sleep now and have to work tomorrow to survive. I wish I had succeeded in April."

cuddlyjail,5dlkk3,1479461393,I might hit a dead end,"I'm on the brink of quitting my studies. Again. I was about to quit about 2 years ago. It was after a long illness, maybe it was depression. I don't know. Back then I decided against it and started to study again. I felt great at first but bit by bit I was hit with obstacles. My registration didn't go through and I couldn't take the test. Tutors never replied to my emails, others declined to tutor me. In the back lingering was the final date when I had to finish. September 30th 2017. 

Yesterday I found a tutor. I should be happy. But the night before the appointment I was so scared I hoped I wouldn't wake up. I was scared to death. I have never felt this bad in my life. It still hasn't gone away. He said no my offer to hand in a paper - this has been done before in our institute - and I had to take a practical course instead. This will take away the time I need to work for an oral exam and I might have to quit my job. I love my work and my colleagues. The money also helps to lessen my financial worries. 

From an outward perspective this is not that bad. But I feel horrible, confused and I just want the fear and devastation to go away. I sabotaged myself in the past and I might have done something or better haven't done that might jeopardize my chances to finish anyway.

 I don't know what to do anymore and just want to lie in bed. I'm 32 and might lose everything. What would I do next if I would quit? Or is it really worth it to hang in there and keep going? I'd be so ashamed to tell anyone. The loser has quit again. I have no idea what else I would do with my life. What I once loved seems dull and worthless, I even hate it. I don't see any perspective for my life. I have never felt this alone in my life. Even the support of the person I love the most does not lessen the pain. Nothing helps. "

throwaway675695675,5cozry,1479022833,The only thing keeping me alive is the fear of death,"Hi.
 
I have been depressed for the last 4 years, but never thought it would go this far. 

I feel like nothing is going my way. 
I am fat. I am ugly. I am a virgin. I am loosing my hair at age 21, and that is ruining my confidence. I have lost many relatives lately. My father (when I was 3), grandmother, aunt and uncle all left us not long ago.

I have social anxiety, and small tasks as shopping groceries is scary. 

I'm afraid of the future. I'm afraid of loosing more people I love. Especially my mother. I cant stand knowing that she will die one day and that I have to live without her.

I have tried many different psychologists, but it just doesnt work...


I'm thinking about suicide every day, and lately I have been thinking about different methods and where to do it. And it scares me that I have gotten this far. The only thing that is keeping me alive is the fear of death.

I don't really believe in any god - but if there was one - why would he treat anyone like this?


Sorry about my english, its not my native language.

When i get up i feel better, i go to college, i cycle a lot, i do homework, but night hours are terrible... Edit: there's nobody who knows this (except reddit ofc)"

After all I did for him the last ten years, stood by after all the inappropriate flirting, his depression that went untreated, taking care of him with his medical condition and this is what he does. He bought an engagement ring in front of my face. 

I have the ring and a bottle of medication. It hurts so bad. He wouldn't even talk or try to work on things. He just snapped and broke up with me due to his supposed midlife crisis. And now I'm forced to move across the country because I have nowhere else to go but back to my hometown. I have to finish packing because I leave in 2 days and I can't stop crying. I'm literally paralyzed by my tears. I can't move from my kitchen floor. Why why why would he do this.

I lost my job last year, ate through my savings because he wouldn't help. Finally find a job and start making friends and putting myself back together and he does this. I can't do this. It hurts too bad. 

Fuck. "
Signosfer,5e4w7y,1479745590,A matter of perception and choice.,"This is something I have been living with for 12 years and I need perspective. 

When I was 17, I felt it for the first time... This feeling that nothing really matters in the end. And so I did my homework and found out how many of which pills I needed to fix it.

I woke up later in the hospital, my parents were bawling their eyes out and I felt like an ass. I did it wrong and felt twice as wrong for putting my family and friends through it.

Now, I am 29, own a nice bungalow, earn top dollar and still, it feels like I just stumbled through life because thats what people do. 

Is it really wrong to think I am done with it all? I feel absolutely terrible for those I would leave behind (99% of why I am here now) but there is nothing for me, every day is awful, nothing in the future is appealing, exciting or even remotely interesting.

My conscience wants me to ask for a second opinion."
jwpcrew,5f0txu,1480185430,I find no joy in life anymore.,"Im 17, I was smoking weed since the beginning of last school vacation. I never found myself very sociable, but weed helped me and my social life got pretty good. It wasn't abusive use, I bought it when I had money, and wasn't high 24/7 but smoked once a day and it was enough. However around 1.5 months ago my parents found out. They are very anti drug and did not listen to my arguments why It's not bad for me. Since then I don't talk to them, if they don't accept how I want to live my life. My grades in school were good, smoking hasn't influenced my education at all. Recently they started to take my phone and computer for night, which was my only entertainment, since they don't let me go out in the evenings. All the shit makes me very stressed, my life now is only school, and I have less and less motivation to take it seriously. I just don't see point in living. I'm from eastern Europe and there are no opportunities for youngs. I know it all sounds pathetic but that's how it is and every night I think about killing myself. If my parents would be supportive and would let me enjoy my life, then I would be very happy. But that's not the case and it just overwhelms me. Any advice would be appriciated."
hanamorino,5c92pt,1478798914,I'm thinking of killing myself later this afternoon.,"First off, I've never ever used Reddit before so if I'm doing something wrong I apologize. 

This is also going to be kind of long, with probably some grammar and spelling mistakes because i wrote it in a hurry.

 I guess I just want to get everything out there while I still can.

I really don't even know where to start. I'm female and i turned 18 just a few weeks ago and it hasn't been this bad before, but close.

Everything, no matter what it is, is always my fault in some way. No matter how nice or how good I try to be, its never enough for anyone. I probably sound like an angsty teenager right now but I really don't know how else to phrase it. I go out of my way for people because I love to see people happy, I love seeing genuine smiles and happiness on them, but its either ignored or passed off as me just wanting something in return.
I've partaken in self destructive behaviour for as long I can remember. I've self harmed for about 7 years, the scar tissue on my left arm is so built up everything is too dull to do anything. I have a nasty habit of burning myself now. 
Now  I go long periods of time without eating anything as well. Even when it gets to the point that my chest and stomach are aching bad enough to make me wince just from moving I don't eat. Eating is the only thing I can control.

My mom is an alcoholic with BPD, I grew up with her threatening to abandon my sister and I and kill our dad, followed by her telling me I was unwanted and cutting phone cords and locking us in the house so we couldnt leave. About three years ago she tried to burn our house down and I haven't seen her since. 
My dad isn't abusive, but his idea of parenting is blowing up in my face and pointing out everything that's wrong with me and not even being satisfied when I'm crying so hard I can't even breath, then telling me I'm disrespectful so I pretty much deserve everything that's happened to me. And what kills me is that everyone agrees with him when they dont even know what happens at home or how I'm honest to god feeling.
I've been diagnosed with MDD and according to my psychiatrist its fairly severe. I've been hospitalized numerous times.

I've always hated myself. I've never been asked out which never bothered me until lately when its beginning to reinforce the idea that I'm an unwanted, undesirable human being who should've killed herself the first time she thought about it.
Last night we had a ""meeting"" with his girlfriend who moved in recently. Originally it was because my sister was upset about something but it always went back to me being a fuck up in some way. 

I've tried being nicer than I thought possible. I've tried respecting them more than I ever have. My grades arent bad at all, I don't smoke or anything like that so I'm not a stereotypical ""bad"" young person. 

Nothing I do is good enough because no matter what I will always be the problem child who shouldn't have been born.

I've tried telling myself that if I stick around things will get better, that even someone as messed up as I am can find love, but everyone always says that no one will love you until you love yourself, and I'm never going to love myself so I've given up on ever finding someone to love and to have love me. I would settle for someone who routinely beat me until I passed out as long as they told me they loved me.
I don't deserve love, or happiness, or kindness. 
I deserve to suffer and rot which is exactly what is going to happen.
Yeah, i'm just trash.

I've tried telling others, even with my therapist and psychiatrist present, but no one believes me. They think I'm like this just to garner attention and sympathy and to get out of doing things. Any attempt at defending myself during an argument is passed off as me being disrespectful.
They don't know how many times I've honestly had to drag myself away from a bridge because I wanted nothing more than to just throw myself off of it. How many times I've sat there with a bottle of pills in my hand both trying to will myself to overdose and trying to will myself to keep going.

I probably sound like a bratty child who is just mad because they aren't getting what they want.
I've looked for reasons to keep living and keep trying
But
I'm sick of constantly angering and bothering everyone, 
so I think by killing myself I'll just guaranteeing that I will never bother anyone ever again.

Right now I'm planning to go home, send a text to those who would most likely find my body, and a text to my siblings and my one friend in TN telling them i love them, and then overdosing.

I don't know what else to do.

I thought getting away from my hometown and being able to study something I enjoy (film and writing) that I would become happy. But everything is the same, maybe even worse because I'm beginning to realize that I am everything that's wrong with me. I don't know how to fix myself.

There's no job I'm right for. I have poor social skills and not a lot of common sense, and I don't think I'm reliable or stable enough for most 9-5 jobs. I love storytelling, which is why I always thought I'd be a writer, but now I feel like my writing is so mediocre that it could never be published. I have so many missing assignments that its becoming unmanageable. And its not that I'm out partying (I have no friends at college) its just that I can't bring myself to do them. I understand how much my irresponsibility with my grades is hurting me, but I can't seem to change it. I have no motivation. How am I supposed to live in the real world with a real job if I can't even handle a few essays? I'm beginning to feel like I'm just not meant to live. I am weak, and have no purpose. Survival of the fittest, right? I want to jump onto the tracks of the subway, but I'm afraid that it might not kill me, just severely cripple me which would make life even worse obviously."

overalready2016,5fqkmx,1480523889,My husband will let me die,"I'm ashamed to be posting here. I'm too old for this. I have had suicidal thoughts and self harmed for almost 20 years. I never got help and I never will. I am too ashamed and afraid to get help and no one in my life cares.

In middle school I told my mother when I started cutting myself. I was scared. She didn't take me to a Dr or therapist. I kept cutting. Over the next few years I told her two more times- both times she acted like she never knew. Even swore I had never told her about it. She forgot. She completely forgot that her daughter came to her in tears on three separate occasions to show her cuts on her legs and arms and beg for help. She forgot. That's how much I matter. 

I don't really cut anymore. Instead I beat. I pound my fists on my thighs and hips and walk around with purple bruises under my clothes. No one knows except my husband. The man who is supposed to love and protect me, and care for me ""in sickness and in health."" I've told him I feel suicidal, I horribly depressed, I hate myself, I want to die, I hurt myself again. I've told him I want help but I'm scared. I've  begged him to just sit at a computer with me and help me find a therapist because I'm too scared to do it alone. One night when it was really awful and I felt sure I was going to go too far I begged him to take me to a hospital. He didn't. 

The people who are supposed to love me don't care. I don't know why I think a bunch of strangers on the Internet might care. My family and my husband are all willing to just let me suffer and die. I guess that's it then."

VanillaMaccaroni,5b0xe7,1478223878,There's a bridge near my new house...,"On Tuesday morning I woke up feeling exhausted. 

My head was pounding with a headache, my nose snuffed up, my shoulders hurt, my chest was tight, my back was aching. 

I cried. I cried hard. 

I cried about the rash consuming my legs. I cried about how I have little meaningful relationships. 

I cried about how I assume people think of me. I cried about my job. And my living situation. 

I cried about being different. 

I pulled myself together for a moment and decided to go to a walk-in clinic. Something I've been putting off for months.

I went downstairs and jumped in the shower. And I sobbed while washing my hair. And screamed and yelled at myself, and the world; not through anger or hate, but because of my inability to change, or more so the self-sabotage that I routinely commit. 

I dried off avoiding my reflection in the mirror.

I microwaved some chicken fingers, and drank a bottle of water. I watched a YouTube video about a board game. 

And then I cried some more. 

I called the local mental health crisis centre (where I've dragged myself to in the past) because they've called me twice in two weeks, and I haven't returned either of their calls. 

I scheduled a meeting with a counsellor for two weeks from now, knowing damn well I might not make it that far. I don't have a doctor, but I know what I do have: and undiagnosed mental illness. Or I'm looking for a crutch. Something to label myself so I know it's not my fault for putting myself in the positions I do.

At this point I was dressed, and ready to leave my house. I put on my sunglasses and headed out, but I didn't head toward the busy main street, or the clinic. I started off toward the bridge. A pedestrian bridge towering above jagged rocks and a river with an unforgiving current. 

I walked slowly and confidently down the street toward the park housing the bridge. My mind ablaze with the thoughts of ending it. The image of myself laying upon the rocks for hours. My lungs filling with blood. Cold. Scared. 

But I turned at the last second. Left instead of right. And just walked; for hours. I walked until the road ended, and I was exhausted. 

Then I walked back on the busy main street. 
Watching the people going on with their days. 
Only stopping the get a pack of cigarettes, which I had quit two months prior, and a coffee. 

And then I went home.

The thoughts are still there, but I have them in check again. 

To die another day."
naomininety,5ctj7v,1479089184,no reasons to live (please excuse the unoriginal title),"hi lovelies. 

I have nowhere to turn and found this community. My life is a dead end. I'm 26 and have not built anything for myself. I have no partner (I've never even had a boyfriend because I'm just a loser), I don't make a lot of money at work even though it's a professional job that requires a college degree, and I have no friends. All I do is go to work then go home and sit alone. I am so upset that I allowed my life to become this. Additionally I just feel like there is no point to being alive. I have nothing to offer work. I have nothing to offer men (like seriously what guy would want to date someone my age who hasn't even had sex before, that's embarrassing.) so I feel like I have no other options but to opt out. If you read that thank you so much I'm just in a very dark place and this is all I have."
nightkat89,5dcvsx,1479343265,So sick of everything going wrong.,"I apologize for the long and drawn out post.

So my situation is simply this. I am currently dealing THE with assholes at United collections bureau for Ohio who want to start garnishing my wages at my already underpaid job. The rate at which they want to garnish will cripple my pay to the point of not being able to pay my car payment, which leaves me open for repossession. If I lose my car, I lose my job. If I lose my job, I lose what little good things I have left in this life like my dog, my apartment, any sense of productivity, anything.

I owe money to a community college I went to a couple years ago who administered me more money than I should of gotten and it was already spent by the time they tried to contact me (school is stupid fucking expensive). They sent me over to a collections bureau after off and on making payments of 20 dollars a month to the whopping 1750.00 balance I owe. (This is not even a school loan, it was a fuck up long story short)

They said to show good faith and get a payment plan established I need to pay them a minimum of the balance due which they were ok with 519.00. I don't know about anyone else but I'm a poor college student coming from a poor family and just trying to make my way in life. I don't have that money laying around as I live paycheck to paycheck.

I also see an endocrinologist for hormone treatment because I came out as trans a couple years ago and have been on HRT since April of this year. If I lose my income source because of these people, I lose my wellbeing along with it.

So much is at stake and I've negotiating with them for a lower garnishment and no matter what I plea, it falls on deaf ears.

If money is truly the root of all evil and will literally send what little life I've built crashing down, then what is the point of even being here?

Yea I could attempt to file for bankruptcy at the age of 26 working retail and being a college dropout. That'll just drag me through the mud further.

I doubt any of you are even reading all of this, and if you decided to reach this point, thank you for listening and actually caring enough. This may be one of the last things I write on this Earth as it seems there is no way out from my current situation.

I'm done trying to make my way and always fail. I'm done being a disappointment. I've already started cutting again and I can't remember a recent night that I didn't cry myself to sleep.

Makes me wonder if it was ever worth it. Why did I even bother trying to make something of myself when I'm so fucking pitiful.

Here is hoping you all have a happy holiday season and god bless.

COREY-IS-A-BUSTA,5dcw0p,1479343335,Need to talk,"I've been struggling with depression for the better part of 7 years. I've attempted suicide once before, over a year ago . My first girlfriend cheated on me a little over 2 years ago and I had to go on anti-depressants after that. Following, I met someone new. I love this girl, absolutely love her, we've been together for a better part of a year. Well we recently went away for college, and long distance relationships are hard. Out of nowhere she just kinda decides we're done. boom, shattered my life. She knew how bad I struggled with this and was always there for me so this makes It hurt even worse. I don't want to make It seem like its solely on her, but its certainly a factor. I was having a hard time with my depression and anxiety in college but this just makes it almost impossible to deal with I feel. I really don't wanna go down this path but I'm getting the feeling I have no other choice...."

She decided I was ""too much to deal with"" stopped talking to me, claimed (falsely) I was stalking her,  took me to court which resulted in me losing all of the friends I had at that point in time. I wanted to kill myself. I wanted nothing more than to be dead. I almost flunked out of school and was sent into a spiraling depression.  Fast forward to February of 2014 I met someone who would become my best friend then. Now come to today. Due to the results of the election and who I voted for,  she is very angry with me and we have been fighting a lot. I don't know if I can handle losing another best friend. Another person who I trust. Another person who matters to me and that their opinion of me matters a ton. She's someone who honestly I thought was the one person who cared about me. I still think she does but us fighting is tearing me apart. I haven't had an appetite.  I haven't been able to sleep well. I juts lay in bed all day,  forget to do homework barely get up to go to class. I just feel dead inside. I'm worried about myself if we keep fighting. I'm worried I'll want to kill myself again. Right now I'm feeling like I'd rather be dead than alive. But still am able to think rationally enough to know killing myself won't solve anything.  
Idk what to do right now and idk why I'm saying stuff here, but here it is.  I guess I'm going to try one of those hotlines see if that helps."

I'm pretty much a total shut in besides a couple weekly times I meet a friend. It's because my social phobia just exploded five years ago l, and I can't seem to get any better, so I'm unable to get back into the workforce. I can barely go to the grocery store I feel so anxious.

Anyway, three months ago my therapist terminated my therapy and I was devastated. I totally freaked out because she was the one person in my life who deeply understood my symptoms and who I trusted. Anyway, I pretty much said a lot of angry and accusatory things during that last session. 

Then I got drunk and called her cellphone crying. The next three days I spammed her email with insane emails, alternately trying to apologize, thank her for her help, or accuse her of abandoning me.

We had one last therapy session after that, and left things on a somewhat positive note. I made a vow to myself not to drink and to follow my medication routine strictly, and also not to harass her with any email.

I kept that vow these last three months. But this week I've felt so anxious and suddenly could see the situation from her point of view. Now I just feel horrible about the really mean things I said and wrote, and I just feel terrible.

I wrote her a quick note just to say 'hi' on Monday. I didn't apologize more because I already did that. I just wish I knew she forgives me and doesn't harbor ill feelings towards me. 

But she didn't answer my email.

I'm so consumed with grief, regret and guilt. The pain is horrible."

I appreciate the support, but I'm just fed up with put on a facade smile for people and not being able to get out of bed without taking something. For people who haven't dealt with depression, take this moment to think of yourself dying you will no longer exist. That void of emptiness. I want you to think of all the people you love and value...  and the memories that you have, and the experiences that you will never get,..  and if you are smart; you will be feeling a degree of fear, and to someone with depression having felt this fear and the absolute certainty to their end.

 Alright, i guess i should give a bit of back history. I never used to have this problem.  Never thought i would be better of gone. That everyone else, including my 2 year old would be better off. It started when my marriage fell apart. But i managed to pick myself up and try to find stability for my daughters sake. For a while i was okay. Then my bf and i rekindled an old flame and started dating. When things were good its awesome, but i couldnt genuinely tell you how long ago it was good. Hes got anger and control issues. On top of adhd and bipolar.  Hes hit me more thsn a few times  (even after knowing im pregnant) he's tried to strangle me. Spit in my face. He's made every insecurity ive had about myself 1000x worse. He tells me im a horrible mother. Threatens to get my daughter taken from me. Hes kept me hostage in our own home.for instance today when i realized i wasnt okay mentality he refused to take me to the hospital or let me get help. He does all this then he apologies and were okay for another month or so. Todays our 8 month. We've been fighting since last night and i started having braxton hicks contractions due to stress so i made myself a bubble bath to calm myself. Well not five minutes in i had to jump out because my mind is screaming at me to drown myself. I manage to get out and dry  off. Notice he's too busy playing counter strike to notice how distraught i am so i text him im going to try and go to bed. He ignored it. Now im in the spare bedroom trying to sleep just to escape these thoughts screaming at me to end it. A million diffrent strategies building in my head. I just want it to stop. I just want peace. And if killing myself is the only way to acheive it now that im so broken then thats what I'll do.

KomradePony,5d7dg2,1479271318,Well... that means I am down to 2...,"I have had people call me their friend for years and it just is not true... but at the start of the year I started tracking who my real friends are...

I attempted suicide last week. A friend showed up and stopped be before I could do more damage to myself... the thing is this ""friend"" also had not talked to me in a week because their housemates have weird anxiety around me and she decided to side with them. Which I can understand since it is a poly group but... it just hurts so much...

All of them were my close friend... I would have moved the world for them... then they just poof and vanish on me... but not before that person starts dating me... so two days of having the best days of my life and all of a sudden complete silence from all of them..

They all of course feel bad about just leaving me in the dark but seriously!? FUCKING SERIOUSLY!? Finally today one of them came over to actually talk and clarify and what I find out is just heartbreaking... misconstruing what I have said and taking super petty shit and making it into huge issues with ""we just dont know how to deal with this"" WELL THAT IS NOT MY FUCKING FAULT! But I guess I get to just deal with it right? RIGHT? FUCK Me.

The whole litany of my year is:

Feb - in the ER 3 times due to organ failure from depression and anxiety (oh ya it can get that bad folks!)

Mar - came out as trans! surprise!

May - start HRT

August - get disowned by my parents, spend birthday getting shuttled around by the 2 friends I am left with now because they are BAMFs

november - VA tells me I am not eligible for GRS because fuck the USA. Seriously fuck you all. I served and did horrible things and all I am asking is to not have to hate part of my body anymore... I just want to feel right... 

OH! not to mention got a foreclosure letter... so... ya......... thanks va... thanks ""friends""... thanks america... not sarcastically thank you President Obama... atleast you tried...

I just am left with this stark reality. I can continue living with my suicidal ideations... oh ya... forgot to mention those... or I can just commit suicide and leave. I am so ready for the next adventure... but why does it have to hurt so much to go?"
[deleted],5elfxn,1479955663,I wish suicide was easy.,"Suicide is so hard to do because too many people object to it, it is easy to fail, you can get fined, and so on. I just want to be able to walk into a clinic and explain my reasoning for suicide and I just get some lethal injection that kills me instantaneously. I've wanted to die for 13 years and I should have the basic human right to die. I do not want to live at all. I don't give a fuck if my parents will be hurt."
NerdyJesusTM,5ahjhj,1477979319,I can't be better. My death is the best option for everyone.,"this post is weird and long. Its not as immediately depressing as usual post on here, and it really just seems like whiny bitching, so i understand if you font want to read it, but to anyone who wants to try to read my delema, thank you. Be warned; unintentional bragging in the first couple lines i guess.

Its weird to think about it; I had just had one of the best weekends of my life. Friday night I went to a real party. An UNREGISTERED PARTY (I'm a freshman so this was a big deal for me.) It turned out amazing: I got drunk to where I was confident and silly but not dizzy. I danced, and ended up getting GRINDED ON. TWICE. AND THE GIRL INITIATED IT. This blew my FUCKING mind because not only am I a socially awkward nerd, but because I look like a damn rapist (but i also look like Jesus [side note if i shaved and cut my hair I'd just look like a fat dyke rn so im fucked both ways]). Anyways, after that I managed to achieve the balls to nonchalantly tell my highschool crush (who's bangin' AF) that she looked cute at the party. AND IT WENT WELL. SHE WASN'T CREEPED OUT BY IT. so Friday night went well. Saturday night, I went to my hometown to see my best friend/ brother, cuz there was a party going on. the party was shit, but I at least got a bit of booze here and there, and after we left we went to waffle house and had a bit of bonding time (at least from my perspective.) so those two nights were amazing. It was looking like my whole week was gonna be made because of those two nights. Until Sunday night. I made a terrible mistake: I looked at my GPA. Due to tax fuckery, I somehow wasnt able to get much in student loans, and since I was a lazy cunt in highschool, i didnt get any scholarships, except for my states lottery scholarship, which is $1000 first semester, $4500 each subsequent semester. I NEED this to stay in school. To keep that one though, you have to maintain a 2.50 GPA. I'm at 1.10 GPA. Its 2 weeks in to the second quarter. To get a 2.50 i have to get like almost a b- in every class. In an effort to save time, the odds are stacked the fuck against me. There is an extremely high chance I will flunk college. That would mean losing all the friends I made, all my chances at love, all my chances at a normal career. I have a plan B; from january to august, if i flunk, ill live in my car, and spend all hours of the day working to make money to pay people back or working out to join the marines, and regain my honor (I also come form a long line of marines). If I fail the marines, Ill do the only other option; suicide. At that point, I will be complete human garbage, to society, to my family, and to the government, so t that point its kinda reasonable yeah? Except the stress of this whole situation makes me want to move it up some. I want to end it now before I can disappoint anyone. The chances are high that I'm gonna be a complete fuck up. I'm not very strong, I'm weak and pudgy and lazy, so marines is a hard bet. Suicide seems easier. 

I've had a history of mood dips. Its not unifrom or anything, like my therapist says its most likey not bipolar, but every now in then, either by a catalyst or by random, I'll go into a depression dip. I'll feel like complete shit, and just be sad and put myself down. it happens a lot around birthdays, because I'm very self conscious about the things I like (Star Wars figures, gundams). Usually suicide never becomes a real possibilty in them; ill think about it, but get to scared of death, and say ""nah"". But this time it seems like the best course to go. I dont even think this is a mood dip; I think this is just my new reality. I am completely fucked. All I feel is pain. I just want the pain to end so badly. Im still so fuckin afraid of death. I probably wont get ther, but I want it so badly this time it hurts. not to mention ive been crushing over a freind of mine so hard it hurts (I cant be with her because i am 100% not enough for her). but fuck that whore, she doesnt matter.

 I dont really know how to end this. i dont even know how anyone could respond to this fucking mess of a post. I just wanted to vent because im in physical pain because of this. Im so sad that i let my whole family down. I just want someone to kill me, like a murderer or something, cuz im too chicken shit to pull the trigger myself. Thank you to anyone who actually got through this disaster fuck fest of a post."

baileyanne94,5aqnew,1478101815,Why the fuck am I still here,"Life's been such stupid bullshit. I had to be born to a mom that fucking hates me because I'm not 'cool' the way she wants. My dad was an arrogant asshole who could do no wrong in his eyes and when I tried going to them for help as things were getting worse for me, they didn't care. My husband always starts fights with me over stupid things and I can't say anything ever or stand up for myself without it getting worse; I usually can't say anything, anytime without it starting some stupid bullshit. This transcends into my normal life though. Literally every word I say causes some kind of problem, everything I do is wrong, and I'm the only one to ever be chastised. I can't even do or enjoy anything without it being accompanied by anxiety and guilt, so I prefer the days where my husband leaves for work rather than when he stays home, especially days like today where I dared to tell him I didn't like something and it started a stupid bullshit fight and now my day is ruined. It would've been better if he'd just left but I know ultimately that I'm the one that needs to just go. I'm not good enough at anything and have no friends that I don't just know/sometimes hang out with through my husband and I know I'm sub-human to them like everyone else anyway. I know and accept that I'm garbage. No one's ever truly liked me. Any friends I've ever had since I was 4-5 (I will or would be 23 in February) have all up and abandoned me at some point. My husband has been my best friend for 8-9 years and I tell him too that he'll get tired of me and start to hate me eventually. He cries when I bring up me killing myself but I know he'll be better off. He can spend some years being depressed about me being gone (which wouldn't happen because it's me) then move on, or I stay alive and we stay married and he's miserable forever.
I've never been a bully but being nice doesn't matter either. It really doesn't matter in this life; if you're gonna be shit on, you're gonna be shit on. I've always had some curse or something attached to me that makes me just by default the least popular/most unliked/friendless person in any group, at any time. It's not fair that life is this shitty but people still expect you to not commit suicide. What a load of selfish bullcrap that is. Ok, then I don't kill myself and literally nothing changes, but I didn't commit suicide so it's all ok, right?
I fucking hate myself and my life. I'm not going to do anything great and every time things seem ok, I'm always proved wrong. I feel so tired or in some kind of pain all the time and that's not compared to the slightly pain-tinged, empty, heavy black-hole I've got in my head in place of a brain.
This has all beaten me down so much that I can start to seem pretty dead or gone in my eyes when these things happen, but the desire to stab myself or walk into traffic doesn't stop.
I wanna die and be thrown into the trash heap where I've always belonged. What a stupid waste of breath that could've been given to someone who would've been liked and done well.
I wish euthanasia was more of a thing, then I wouldn't be spending my life making everybody else miserable by accident and in turn ruining things for me as well. I've used services like hotlines or 7 Cups of Tea or whatever but the hotline people are rude/unresponsive and the 7Cups person literally did not understand me, but I got matched with them. I hate seeing those services advertised to me when I look into suicide methods or planning. They don't work. I can't even tell people my stories/situation without feeling like I'm making it up to get attention. Every time I feel all better, all these things just come back to attack me again and remind me that life isn't my sweet picnic to have with others.
My reasons to stay aren't enough to sustain a life...some music, hobbies sometimes, my dog, occasional good times...that's not enough in life though. 
This is a time where I'd be ok with someone killing me on the street in some freak accident...
Life is like chess and some of us are meant to be kings, queens, knights, then you have to have pawns...I'll accept my role on the chessboard, then..."

KillemKindly94,5d5rei,1479251338,Just want to end it all and be done with this misery,"Don't even know how to start this off, im so fucked up i dont think i can be helped yet im about to post this hoping for anything to latch onto because im a pussy and i can't kill myself. its just what i want so anyway il post the majority of my life and my life now and why im sick and tired of doing things and listening to family who haven't got a clue on what this is like for me.

When i was 9 i had a good life up until i was 13. When i Reached the age of 13 i met a girl who i loved very much, it lasted 2 days and i never spoke to her again, since that day i avoided her up even tho it was killing me inside and she was over me, so anyway i leave for Secondary School at about 14 i didn't do good i actually dropped out a month later because i was so depressed, i stopped going to school and i stay in house all the time, i spent 4 years depressed and suicidal because of a girl who i was with for 2 days, i never told anyone why because i thought they would laugh at me, I am 22 this week and for 8 years ive left my house about 200-250 times, I'm not overweight but im not healthy and my body doesn't feel good at all.

When i was 16 i suffered from severe social anxiety and depression from what happened to me at 13, Now from 16 to 22 ive rarely spoken to anymore, I always felt like people were better than me and that i was 1 out of a million that just wasnt suppose to be here, for example, i meet people they're like ""oh ye nice"" but if it were someone else they'd be more engaging and interested in them, ive seen this countless time, it's like no one even notices me sometimes and that's also just worsened my anxiety and depression i feel, not being able to be as interesting as someone else even tho i mean well, it hurts me alot inside cause i have no one and i try my best or did try.

Now i'll tell you what's been recent in my life

Last week i bought Modern Warfare Remastered on the Xbox One, I also don't have a mic cause i can't talk to people online because they make fun of my voice even tho i think its fine its messes with my head and i get depressed over it, so anyone i grind the game out and i reach #2 overall in the world and today ive just been getting ddos'd , but keep in mind this xbox is my only outlet in life, i have nothing else it makes me have friends and feel some enjoyment, I've recently said im quitting the game because if i do anything good it ends in a bad way, i just cant do something without someone ruining it and making me feel like crap.

atm my little brother is very very sick and hes trying to watch some toy review thing on youtube or something, and he couldn't because of this guy ddosing me, i almost broke and start crying because it was late and all he wanted to do was watch it, i didn't know what to say to him. it made me feel like a failure as a brother.

now im here on the verge of just jumping from a bridge cause i cant deal with life anymore, its filled with me alot of pain and i just cant cope anymore, i just want it to end.

this post is being posted cause i dont give a fuck anymore, i dont care if this is embarrassing"

throwaway_2372187,5c144u,1478698627,I tried to end it last night,"Last night was going to be the day for me. I listened to a few songs and wrote a note before I put a belt in the crack of my closet door, padded the belt with a washcloth, and squeezed my therapy plush as I let go. I could feel myself going. I could smell something like blood and formaldehyde. My arm started to go limp and I nearly passed out. At the last second I pushed the belt off my neck; I really don't know why. Maybe it was reflex. I was kneeling on the floor, breathing quickly and rapidly, my thoughts racing. I decided I had to try again because that night was the night and I put myself back in the belt and sloppily stuffed the padding back in front of my neck. Again, I let go, holding onto my therapy plush, but I pushed harder onto my arteries. I swallowed and I realized I wasn't restricting anything so I pushed the belt off again. I was in shock. I crawled onto the floor and cried into the plush for an hour. I was frozen and shaking and I couldn't really think straight. It was the most fear I've ever experienced in my whole life. I looked in the mirror later. My eyes were bloodshot and I have a large red, vertical mark on my neck, right under my chin. I don't know what to do. I feel so lost and worthless. I feel like I really died last night. I have no motivation. I feel empty. I don't know what to do. I don't want to go back into society but I have to. I just can't stand anything right now. I wish this could end. "
RedditHelpMe9407,5bi088,1478465779,Last night I tried and failed,"So after a week now of deciding I wanted this after losing my ex, because of the hurtful way she did it and continues to hurt me.

So I wrote a note to all my family and my ex and emailed it her hoping she would at least find out if I was okay but after half an hour of telling her and her seeing the email, I logged into her email, she didn't reply, so that was it my mind was set! 

So I tied some ties to the loft ladders and created a noose and hung myself, I remembered it being slightly uncomfortable for a  few minutes then the next thing I remembered was being on the floor really confused, then I saw the broken tie next to me and remembered. I was so upset it didn't work, because when I blacked out it felt so peaceful! 

I spent a day in a mental ward after my family found me there and took me to A&amp;E. now I tried it and saw how it took all my pain away I am to do it again properly but I saw how hurt my family were and I don't want to hurt them :("

[deleted],5fesvg,1480372617,I will never be in a happy relationship.,"I have an awkward sexual orientation; I'm homoromantic-heterosexual. As the name implies, I basically only fall in love with guys, but only have sexual feelings for women. There are some exceptions; I can ""like"" a girl, and I am somewhat attracted to guys (just not below the waist).

So, I don't think that a long-term relationship is realistic for me. If I commit to a women, I will never love her. And, if I commit to a man, I will never be able to have a sex life.

I'd be ok with falling in love with a man, living together, and just rarely or never having sex. But, I know that no one else would be ok with that kind of life.

So, without love, is life worth living? I don't think so...

SirTacoKitty,5ekgwm,1479943111,What should i do?,"Every time someone screws me over, lies, or destroys my trust i inch closer and closer to the edge of darkness. As of right now i'm only a few steps from falling right off into permanent darkness, once that happens i will either die or go full blown insane. Everyday i wake up disappointed, disappointed that i woke up in the first place, if i could stay asleep and dream forever i'd definitely do that because in my dreams i can do whatever i please with any limitations, without my depression, and definitely without any emotional and physical pain i experience in reality. Day by day i go on feeling more dead than alive, just sitting or laying around doing meaningless tasks for no reason, only rarely does something happen that brings a little joy into my sad, hopeless, and pathetic life. There is only one person that brings me joy and that's my best friend, i care/think about him all the time, not even a few weeks ago he confessed his love for me/told me he has feelings for me..... At first i was really shocked and confused to why/how he could love me, but as i thought about it more and more i secretly felt the same for him.... I am a guy and no i'm not gay but i don't know i just really really love talking and being around him, he makes me happy unlike everyone else in my life, unlike everyone else in my life including my family this guy actually supports/respects my ideas, dreams, and passion. that is what i love about him the most other than the fact that we are very much alike and are mentally and physically connected. One thing i hate/like about myself is that i absorb peoples emotions... So you can imagine that with all the horrible emotions, thoughts, and memories i already have festering in the deepest parts of my mind, absorbing even more horrible feelings and emotions doesn't make anything better for me. One thing i love doing is helping people out of that darkness that i'm currently in by helping them see the light they so desperately need/want in their lives, and every day i'm with them i try to slowly repair them back to a person that does not seek death and nothing in their lives but happiness and what they truly want in life. This brings me so much happiness knowing that i helped someone out of this pit of darkness and helped them realize that there is hope out there, there is something out there made just for them that will definitely bring them the happiness they've been searching for/wanting all this time. So after saying all this it should be obvious that i absolutely love helping people and making them happy even if i have to add all their bad emotions and thoughts to my already overflowing closet of bad thoughts, memories, and feelings in my mind. But to me it's definitely worth suffering 24/7 just to make someone else's life better and more enjoyable. 

One other thing i forgot to mention is that everyday i'm in a constant battle with all of my 5 personalities/voices that talk to me almost every hour of the day except for when i have my headphones on listening to music or watching random youtube videos. I can easily tell the difference between them from what each one is talking about or saying to me, All the ones i know of currently is My insane voice: (The one that tells/gives me horrible thoughts of killing/hurting people or myself), My bad/mean voice: (The one that tells me to say horrible or very mean things to my friends, family, and people i meet). My good voice: (The one that i talk to regularly, this one is constantly telling me what's right from wrong and talks to me about almost anything that i want to talk about and sometimes comes out of no where and asked me things that start hour long conversations with this voice), My true inner voice: (This voice is my true inner self talking and is always the one that makes the decisions that it thinks are best in my life and that is what i'm truly looking for in life.... But with having depression this voice doesn't really get to make many decisions anymore, my depression usually fucks my decision making skills/voice up), The last voice is something i've only told 1 person and it will hopefully stay that way. 

The only reason i haven't already given up is that i'm hoping something/someone will help me out of this darkness but every time i think someone is about to try or succeed with it never goes through with it.... They never stay true to the end. Ever. I 100% serious this time i'm so damn tired of all the disappointment, stress, pain, worry, numbness, dishonesty, untrustworthy people, and all the other bullshit i have to deal with. If one more close person screws me over i know for a absolute fact i will either kill myself or go full blown insane and start killing other person (I would much rather kill myself then go hurt or even worse kill other people).

Dutchmaster617,5e78jc,1479769694,My only motivation to get a job.,"Is to buy enough alcohol to put me away. I am an alcoholic who has gotten sober and failed 4 times, had 4 months earlier this year...oh to make it even juicier, I am only 25!

I quit a good job a few weeks ago where I excelled at out of depression, mostly because I haven't seen my kids in 2 months, and nobody will do anything about it because I didn't marry the mom and I didn't sign the oldest birth certificate (I had to go to college class and then the lady came right after) I was 17 and dumb so I never tried to follow up because hey this is my kid and my love and we will live together forever...until she cheated on me and took them 60 miles away, now she refuses to let me see them, she is verbally and physically abusing my kids but nobody will believe me, she is sociopathic in nature so she can convince the teachers, judges, cops etc. that she is a great mom. My oldest was on the phone crying and sad but said everything was fine (but that he doesn't do work and fights at school), he is afraid because she states if he ever speak up about what goes on at home she will beat his ass, during the call all she did was scream vile nasty vulgarity stuff that would hurt even an adult. I had a good job a few weeks back I quit out of depression as I knew I would get fired soon. I am broke and cannot afford what the courts or lawyers ask for. I have so much potential but my life sucks and I cannot find a solution, everyone says get a job but money doesn't matter, I could have a million in my closet and still be in bed crying with vodka and beer. I live in a no company home with my father so all the women leave me as I cannot invite them over, he won't even allow my kids to sleep over back when I was getting them on weekends, we had to sleep in hotels or my mothers living room. I can get a good job and money but for what? I will still feel like crap, spend it on liquor, my therapist is useless, zoloft and prozac is useless suggestions (that's all they can do). I am too cowardly to commit suicide but drinking myself to death is an option. I wish there was another option."
TheTweetE,5azpgf,1478210034,I'm not going to do it. But I do wish I could.,"It's been a rough few days. And I'm honestly not doing well. 

Last Friday my work took me down to part-time for a lot of reasons. The long and short of it was that I was having a problem working with the boss. He didn't give clear instructions. He was incredibly negative. I'm just not used to having people dislike my work this much. Usually I go above and beyond and people are happy. This guy, though, I just could not do anything right. 

I suffered all weekend. Trying to prepare for how it was going to feel to go back to work on Monday with this Scarlet Letter of being Less Than emblazoned on my chest. It was going to suck. But I don't run away or quit. I had obligations to myself and to the work. So I show up. 

It's just as awful as you might think. It's tense and awkward. I am all tied into knots. I don't know what to do. In a moment, I tried to make myself feel better and I posted on my personal Facebook that I was a good, hard worker. I go above and beyond. I try hard. I fix problems other have neglected. And I don't deserve for me or my work to be disrespected or humiliated. And I hope to find that situation soon. 

I don't know how he saw it, because I have my shit locked down and we aren't facebook friends. But he did....and with that I was fired. Thrown out. 

So, now I'm unemployed. And I've been crying for days. My stomach is in knots. I feel like a pariah. I feel like a failure. I feel like a useless waste. I feel like this is the way life is always going to be. 

I've been trying though. I immediately got on the job boards and started looking. I've been trying. 

Then today....

I had an appointment with my doctor. I was relieved. This would be helpful. 

But no. My therapist just fired me. He said we've never been a good match. He said I frustrate him. It's clear he doesn't want me back.

Just like work.

I'm sinking fast. I'm in a dark place. 

I wish it was just over. "

cns102394,5ctw14,1479094004,Despite looking good on the outside I feel like I'm dying on the inside,"Ironically, my life might be objectively better than its ever been. I have a lot to be proud of, and a lot of people in my life claim to be proud of me. But knowing that objectively my life is great, only makes it worse that subjectively I want to die.  Every time a family member or a distant friend says, it seems like you're doing so much, or they're so proud of me for working hard, it honestly makes me feel worse. I look through these comment boards and I hear about people who go through life with no one around them. Ironically, I spend tons of time with others, and often get invited places to hang out and do things, and occasionally I go, and I think I even appear to have a good time. But still when I'm done I feel miserable and like I want to die. Some people talk about how they can't get out of bed in the morning. I work 10 and 12 hour days as a law student trying to study and apply for jobs, but honestly it just serves as a distraction from the fact that I want to die. I always go back to baseline wanting to die no matter what else I do. I've always had this feeling that I'm going to kill myself one day, even on my best days. It's scary to me to think that I could be ""accomplishing"" so much and have ""so much to be proud of"" and still feel this way. It doesn't help that I just had a close family friend who committed suicide recently. He seemed like he had his life together. He had kids a family a good job where he traveled all the time, but he was still so depressed that he killed himself. His life almost seems like a prophecy for mine and its scary. I almost wish I showed outward symptoms of being depressed and suicidal, I feel like when I tell people how I feel they assume I must be exaggerating because my life looks so good from the outside. It almost makes me ashamed to be suicidal knowing that so many other people actually have real issues they have to deal with, and I'm just here feeling miserable in spite of my pretty good life. "

I don't want shallow friendships where I'll just be forgotten. I want love. I just feel like I'm going to die alone. I think about my future I can only picture myself all alone wondering what the fuck I'm even doing anymore. I want to give up. I'm sad. Indoor want to do this anymore. I don't want to do anything anymore. I feel like I haven't been truly happy. I'll be safe but I just want to give up. :/

He always hooks up with the girls I like even though he knows. The one thing I thought I was good at was Pull ups, I could about 15 non stop, I have been training every fucking day for the past 4 years, every time I go through my door I would do pull ups(I have got a bar on my door). Today we were doing them, he did twice as me with perfect I mean perfect technique, while mine was sloppy... he doesn't even train pull ups.

I'm a drain on all my loved ones, I've got no discernable skills and I really just don't even want to live to see the end of the year.  I've honestly tried to fix myself so I don't feel this way but at this point I genuinely believe I am just a fundamentally broken person "
lordofflies48,5by0dk,1478661593,I feel like I'm self destructing.,"There's no escape any more. I have been dealing with these intense feelings for the past 6 months, and intermittently for the past 3 years. I'll never be free from pain, I'll never be a well adjusted and happy person. I am collapsing. There is no point anymore. I am going to be like this until I am dead. If my father's life is any indicator, I will be broken forever. There's only one escape, and I'm not allowed to take it. I want out of this life. It feels like I've been asked to carry my own corpse. I'm dragging myself along, weighed down by the corpse and every other responsibility. I just want out."

A_Beautiful_Struggle,5ey9an,1480142416,"Really Starting to Lose Hope. Injured, Can't Pay Medical Bills, Family is Struggling Financially, and I'm Completely Stuck.","I've gone to /r/PersonalFinance, /r/LegalAdvice, and /r/Advice, /r/Depression. Nobody has offered anything helpful. I don't know what to do. 

I'm 23 years old, and I live at home with my parents. Up until recently, I worked full time at a warehouse in Washington state making about $11/hr. Now I work under 3 hours a week.


Back in October of last year, a series of events led up to me being overworked. My best friend killed himself. In order to cope, I worked a lot of hours, sometimes 14-16 a day. Unfortunately, it caught up with me. I injured my back while lifting a heavy load into the garbage bin. I'd always had minor back trouble (diagnosed recently with a mild scoliosis in my thoracic spine) but this really put me out. I was struggling to stand up straight. The pain was so bad, I was having dry heaves, audibly moaning. The next couple days were awful, as I had to deal with severe cramping and sharp pain. 

Eventually it settled down, and I was able to go back to work. I even got an L&amp;I claim approved. I thought chiropractic was all I needed. It was all I was ever approved for, and it did seem to work for a short while... 


Fast forward to August of this year. I start noticing my back trouble was no longer improving. I was only approved for chiropractic care, and seeing as chiropractic doesn't on its own heal the injury, I needed to explore my options. I thought with chiropractic, I could lower the pain and relieve stress, and that the injury would heal on its own. However, nothing was helping anymore. I decided to let my boss know that I was having some trouble. I asked if I could take an extra day off per week in order to recoup. I was hoping it would help. 


I have to say, my company has been extremely supportive and caring. They understand I can't lift heavy loads, but try to find things that can keep me busy and useful without hurting me. They want whats best for me. 

Things continued to get worse. 

I get a letter in the mail stating that I have an Independent Medical Examination scheduled. I go to the appointment. Several doctors were there to examine me at the same time over period of about 10 minutes. They send me home.
One day I decided to let my chiropractor know that I needed to find a way to recover. The chiropractic care wasn't cutting it anymore. Though I made drastic improvements from my initial injury, I was beginning to develop chronic pain. The pain was slowly getting worse and worse. I never got referred to imaging, physical therapy, massage, or anything else that might be helpful.  I decided to ask them if that was possible. They decide to look into it, and see if I can get approved for imaging and physical therapy by L&amp;I. 


Next week, my claim is closed, right as I'm on the brink of finding something that could help. Unable to afford chiropractic, I continue to work full time in pain, until I end up essentially bed ridden a few weeks later. I can't take it anymore. I schedule an appointment with my GP. Get imaging done. Get a referral to an orthopedic specialist. She refers me to physical therapy. Been paying out of pocket for all medical bills since August. I've exhausted my savings and I can't work. 


Meanwhile, my Dad (the only one with an income right now) got a huge pay cut. He was one of the few in his position at his company able to keep his job, but he took a 35% pay cut. In an area where rent is nearly 2k a month on average, this is really bad.


This stress led me to relapse on pornography. For me, when I was a kid, the addiction was terrible. It destroyed me. When I relapsed, I began to recount certain memories. I was involved in an unwanted sexual experience when I was 5. Before that, there were a few other things that were traumatic that I can't fully recount at the moment. I know something happened. My body remembered. I was very young. Probably about 2 or 3. I started having nightmares and dissociating severely. 

My parents helped me put that habit away again. I've been clean since September. 


I went through most of my savings the last few months to afford medical care. As I said, been paying out of pocket for GP visits, opioid pain meds (which are the only things that work, unfortunately) orthopedic specialist visits, and physical therapy. I'm trying to get my case reopened. There was hope last week when I got a letter saying it was reopened, but within 24 hours, they closed the case again. I have $190 in my savings account now. I can't make any more than $150 a month with my current schedule. I can't afford medical care that will get me better so that I can get back to work (had to cancel PT 2 weeks in a row.) L&amp;I is taking forever, even with lawyers on the case. I don't have training in anything else. I'm in pain and I don't know what to do financially. 

Also just found out a couple days ago that the Paid Time Off I was going to use to pay for the medical bills (I thought I had 50 hours available) didn't exist. It was a glitch in the account. They felt bad, but did provide evidence that proved it was true. I believe them, so it's not anything sketchy. They just have to be fair, which I totally understand. Unfortunately, I have to cancel all further appointments for physical therapy. 

I'm also Type 1 Diabetic. I was forced to cancel my appointments with my endocrinologist because I can no longer afford care. My parents can't afford to help me out either, unfortunately. They do what they can, but it's just not possible for them to help me the way they want to. 

I do have a lawyer, but everything is moving so slowly. Quite honestly, I don't see things ever getting resolved. 


Every night I go to sleep and have nightmares. I wake up with a soar jaw because I'm clenching my teeth so bad. 

Has anyone ever gone through something similar? What should I do? Are there any resources available for people like me? Can anyone offer anything more than condolences? I need advice. Please, please help. I'm losing hope. I need something that can actually help me get out of this situation. I'm so incredibly desperate for something to change. I don't know what to do."
Gonzalez92105,5bkw63,1478503025,Why continue? Ready for suicide.,"Hello, to whoever reads this. I'm constantly sad, I constantly think about killing myself. It's practically every day now. I've gone to psychiatrists about this, didn't help. The only good thing that came from going to them was lowering my anxiety. Talking doesn't really help, nor the medication that they've prescribed me. I've been on fluoxetine, Sertraline, and now on... I don't even know what. They don't work. I never get excited about anything, nothing at all gets me excited. I have no dreams, no desires, nothing. I don't see what's the point in living. I really don't. It's not all that great. No matter what activity I do, I don't enjoy. The one thing that I truly loved was to play video games, I absolutely loved them, but now... Not even that gets me excited. I don't like that I don't get excited for anything. I have no friends, but I do have a girlfriend. She's gonna leave me soon though. Something about her not being happy with me, college and shit. She was my first love. Been with her for almost two years now. Now I'm not gonna even have that. I was already sad, and what not, but now even more so once she leaves. I'm 18 years young, and I plan on killing myself once she does. There's nothing else for me. Whenever I think about death, it's always calm, and very peaceful. Only then can I truly be happy. I don't have a horrible life, didn't get raised in a messed up way, no drug abuse, or anything like that. I'm just sad for no reason. I'm so sick and fucking tired of it hinging me down, getting worse, and worse by the fucking day. I cannot take this anymore. I really can't, I'm sure plenty of people have endured a lot more than I have, but this is too much for me to handle. I plan on emptying out my bank account, give practically everything to my family and blow the rest on drugs. Then, end my life. "
nottl,5d8awz,1479287436,i have failed at everything i've ever done.,i don't want this anymore.
Yagrn,5faimz,1480319807,Best laid plans...,"I am sitting here numb at 2am, with work in just a few hours. I took almost the whole week off for Tgiving, but I did nothing. The last few days I have been so numb and anxious, I haven't been able to sleep, eat, or do anything. 
I am not afraid I will kill myself, but I just feel so empty. I want the feeling to go away. I literally have no one to talk to anymore, all friends and connections are gone. It is amazing how life works out.

I have tried for months to make some new connections, it is not much of an option at work, as I work with a few doctors that have been doctors since the 70s aka before I was born, and then most of the work is with animals, so they don't really talk back.

I have tried going out, to the bars and just out and around. I also tried meeting people on stuff like Reddit (almost 9 months, and all the really really nice people that were nothing but nice, ghosted just like everyone else) 
I had a gf, and it made things ok, but just trying talk to her about such things basically made her freak out and push me away, and I think we are done for good...oh ya, that was Thursday. 
My former best friend, when I mentioned being suicidal to him once a few years ago, his response was ""good luck with that"" and it was never really the same again. 
It feels so hopeless, why is it so hard to meet new people? 7 billion people, why is anyone lonely?

In the past, my biggest problem is that I have been too nice, and have been used and taken advantage of. It really sucks when you think someone is the one, change your whole life for someone, move across country, give up seven years, only to find out the whole time you were part of some huge elaborate lie for most of it. Not that it wasn't real, but to be used by the person you care about most is hard. 

I guess I am different and maybe a little weird, and sometimes it turns people off at first. But for my whole life I have had people tell me that once they got to know me I was nothing like they expected. It makes it hard to meet new people, I think. And on Reddit everyone is so judgemental, they read 3 words and decide you are not good enough for them...then make posts on 3 accounts a day saying that they have already talked to everyone here. It is so foolish. 

I am passionate about a ton of things, patient, kind, intelligent, no one has ever called me ugly...I am probably the funniest person I know, I love animals, I am loyal and basically 100% reliable when it comes to keeping my word...I have been self reliant and on my own since 18. I am far from perfect, but how is it that the year is almost over and I can still be so. fucking. alone. 
Isolation is ok for a while, but I don't care who you are--it wears on you. 
You can only fake it for so long, only so many movies, books, songs, video games, etc...and besides...what is the point of any of it it? What is the point of anything beautiful or funny or amazing if you can't find anyone to share it with? 

I guess it is a bonus when you have no siblings or friends or really family, no one will even notice if you do kill yourself. But I don't want to die, I want to live. I just want to be happy. I want the pain to go away, but I have no idea how to even start. I am 33, and I have so much ahead of me and I understand that I don't know what tomorrow brings, but I feel I am just going to be alone forever. And then I will be bitter and angry at myself, because everything told me I would be alone forever, but something stupid called hope gave me this dumb idea that maybe I should go on living because something may change. How long do I wait? For 5 years or so, I have told myself....1 more year, on my birthday Ill do it if I am still unhappy. Well that day is coming up (lucky enough to have an xmas birthday) and I am dreading it, and hating life so much. I have been good all year, I haven't tried to hurt myself in years, and I have worked all year without any breakdowns but I am afraid that now its coming. In the past I always had someone to talk to, what do I do now? I have nobody. No one. If anyone cared, that wouldn't be true. 
I had a few good friends, one who helped so much, she was so supportive...but then one day her boyfriend got jealous she was spending time and attention on me, and he said I was manipulative and all this stuff and to never talk to her again...and I haven't, and it sucks. I guess it all really doesn't matter. People are strange, when you're a stranger. What do you have to do to make some connections with people today? I suck at social media, and I am old fashioned...I think I would have had better luck a few 100 years ago, you know if I didn't die crossing a river, or to a snake bite, or the other million ways to die when life was The Oregon Trail simulator. I would be happy to chat with anyone, but for some reason with the deeper stuff,  I don't really feel comfortable talking about this kind of stuff with a male, if it makes a difference. I am good at taking criticism, maybe someone could even help me figure out what/if I am doing something wrong or obvious. But again, that is something you need to know someone to judge.  NO PRETENSE.

bipolar_advice,5bru6t,1478588554,I [36m] am going through a break-up with my wife [34f] of 5 years and I am thinking of killing myself,"I am depressive and thinking back over my life, I think I've been like this for most of my adult life.

I got into a severe depression in 2009 when a friend died in a car crash, and I had broke-up with a GF of 4 years. Back then I tried to drink myself to death. I went to a psychiatrist, took medication and did therapy.

Now I am suffering crippling anxiety over the future of my relationship, my future alone, my job. I can't think of being alone again, thinking about starting over from scratch, having lost the woman I loved, having no money, having no perspective on what to do since everything I have planned and suffered anxiety over will be gone.

I can't stand the thought of being institutionalised, can't stand the thought of being a burden for my family, and an emotional burden on my future ex-wive.

I don't want to be alone, I don't want to keep going like an automaton, living life without meaning.

I'm thinking of taking a bunch of sleeping pills i have, but the thought of making anyone else suffer because of me is also unbearable. I'm a coward and a failure. I wish I never existed so as not cause anyone any trouble.

I just want to fade from existence. It's 5 AM and i'm trying so hard not to text my psychiatrist and my therapist for help, because I don't want to cause them any trouble.

I need to vent, I need to talk, I need support, I want my wife back, I want my life back, I want control back. But I can only cry, have panic attacks, and feel all knotted up inside, like a really tight wrang up towel.

I want to cease from existing, yet somehow I want to live, but I don't think I can.

**EDIT:**

I'm feeling somewhat better, I had a tearful conversation (more of a soliloquy) with my wife and she understood how I'm feeling, and although nothing is guaranteed, at least I'm not having stupid ideas.

I've contacted my psychiatrist and therapist and will see both today.

Thank you for your support, I really needed to vent and talk/write, it helped structure my thoughts and feelings a bit.

I've also got the suicide hotline number and will call if I feel desperate again.


**EDIT 2:**

I'm feeling much better now after the appointments, had good long talks, and realised I need to reevaluate what I want from my life, and start planning how to achieve it, by myself, or with someone else by my side and not leading the way and strong-arming me emotionally.

I have flushed all the clonazepam I had down the toilet, and dumped the bottle of whiskey down the drain.

Thanks for your support, I really needed to just talk to someone at the time, it helped me deal with my feelings of desperation."

wrathful_acrimony,5dmmpw,1479478914,What Would You Do?,"I really need some help. I haven't been able to leave my apartment in nearly a month. I'm a college student, so at this point I have professors emailing me to let me know I've failed out. I'm on academic probation so this means I'm separated (I can appeal) and I've lost my financial aid for my $60,000/year school. I can take out loans I'm sure, that's not the real issue.



The real issue is I have a job lined up at a fortune 500 company. I won't graduate on time, therefore ruining my job offer in June. I'm tired with life, and how frequently I mess up. I can beg and cry to my professors and the Dean of Students, alongside with Academic Assistance, but none have gotten back to me. I'm currently trying to take online courses over the winter, as I was short credits to graduate anyway, but I'm hesitant to pay for them because I am a failure and I'm contemplating suicide.

I feel killing myself is the best way to escape the onslaught of misery I've heard on myself. My previous post here detailed the horrific abuse I suffered as a child. As an adult I am an empty shell. I feel nothing save bitter disappointment in myself and a great mistrust of those around me. These patterns of failure will continue no matter what. After three hospitalizations for suicide with no results, what would you choose? Am I just being melodramatic? Truthfully, I think I allowed things to get this way because I want nothing left but suicide as an option. And thus far it seems like the best option. How can I pick myself back up with no job, no close family, and no help? Nowhere to go? What would you do?"
NukableAccount,5ajeuw,1478011116,Could Use A Watchman,"Let me open up with stating I'm a glutton for punishment. It's not that I enjoy it, but it seems to always be directed to me. 

I'm officially the company scapegoat now because ""apparently"" I cheated with a project when I got it done ahead of schedule. And instead of actually looking at my work, they trash it and have someone else behind schedule give them sub-par data, and I get put into what they call ""administrative observation;"" aka ""boss is up my ass harder because we don't know what you did.""

My family, whom I live with because it's cheaper to live here than to go back to Florida, each hate me for different reasons. My father hates me because I'd rather take a day off than work a straight 7 day week, calling me weak-willed and pathetic. My mother hates me for not understanding manic-depression; when in all of history has ""just calm down"" ever worked? And my brother... Well, he hates me for being able to read; he's dyslexic. 

The one person I had whom didn't hate me opened up this morning that she does hate me, because I don't listen. I hang on her every word, yet I'm ignoring her. It's shit like this that makes me question what the hell I'm doing with my life and if I should bother continuing. 

I'm trying my damnedest to keep things on the Path, yet it feels like I'm walking The Gauntlet because I took a wrong turn somewhere. And last night, after a long fight with my father, I debated hurting myself. Suicide at this point hangs like a big, bright EXIT sign over an open window, and I don't know if I want to just say, ""fuck it,"" and jump or stay here in this burning building I call my head. 

I live abroad, so finding psychiatric help is virtually non-existent, I can't afford to go back to the States for help, and the only friends I have are all online nowadays. So, I created this ghosting account so I can hide under the infamous ""anon"" mask and maybe get some help. Someone to talk to. An outside voice. Hell, just someone to message me once in awhile and just say, ""Hey, are you OK?"" 'cause right now, I'm not OK. In fact, I am far from OK. For fucks sake, I'm nearly 30 and crying over a keyboard just trying to get help while simultaneously trying to do my job. And please, don't even bring up money. I'm so sick of talk about money. It's all my family talks about and I'm sick of it. Far from broke yet it's all they want. "

It was a culmination of things going wrong in life but after a brief period of it going away, I feel like it's back. It's in a different form now. I have a nihilist's view on life. I struggle to see the meaning behind anything. Why should I go through the daily motions when anything that comes out of it is pointless? My existence is futile and has no effect on this world. The suffering I go through daily cancels out the happiness. I'm a year clean from cannabis and 9 months clean from alcohol but now I feel the pull of them as a way to drown this feeling of meaningless. To stop this way of thought. I'm here because I want to live. We all are here because some part of us wants us to continue in life. I just can't get around this way of thought. Life is hard and tiring. Why endure this when death is easier? If you had a job that made you unhappy and tired, you wouldn't continue with it. Why is life any different? The only way I see suffering ceasing to exist, is to follow a Buddhist path and seek enlightenment.  How did Sisyphus find happiness is doing something so meaningless and repetitive? What is the point in searching for happiness when it is simply an illusion of the mind?

TL;DR I don't want to commit suicide but I simply don't see any purpose or meaning in living. Why do you continue with the daily grind? Why endure?

Kimbapchan,5fpds3,1480509628,I feel useless...,"All my life, my parents have been VERY overprotective of me. While I appreciate and love them for that, there should have been a limit to their overptotectiveness. I understand that they just wanted what's best for me, and that they must have been traumatized because my eldest sister died back then from health issues. I get it. But they raised me to be very dependent on them. I remember my mother wouldn't even let me hold a knife and cook for myself. Nor would she let me go outside on my own. I thought nothing of it when I was younger, but I'm now 24 and she still treats me like I am 4.

It's starting to affect me. I've become very dependent on them. I'm scared to go outside of my own, talking to people on the phone scares me. I get easily nervous. I can't drive and take myself to places I need to go because, like I said, going outside makes me nervous. It's just so hard, I feel helpless and I couldn't do anything on my own. What's worst is that my parents are disappointed in me for not being more independent now that I am older. I know they think I'm worthless. I can read between the lines. 

I started working at our family's company as a secretary and I just sat there at a table like an idiot. My mother expects me to already know what to do in the office even if I have absolutely zero experience. I asked her to train me but she doesn't. She expects me to go around asking people what I should do. I felt like an idiot just sitting there. Even now, she just gives me small tasks even a small child with basic computer knowledge could do. It's a part time job, I get it, but even the unpaid interns were given more work than me. I felt ashamed because there were people YOUNGER than me in that office who do more important work than what I do and I still get paid for it. They think I'm worthless. i am convinced I am worthless. i can't do anything right. I'm too dependent on them and it scares me. They can't live forever, my dad's 74 already damnit. It scares me that they'll leave me and I'll be nothing. This has been bothering me for a while now and I keep wishing I could just wake up dead. I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, but I am sure I will never actually do anything to hurt myself. But these thoughts just won't go away... If I tell my parents I am depressed, they'll just dismiss it as a tantrum. I cried in front of them back then, and told them about everything I felt like how helpless I am and how they keep treating me like a child. They played victim and said 'you can't get mad at us, we're old already!'. I don't know anymore.

I know there are people suffering more than me, but I just don't know where to go to at this point. No one could understand me. I am still very scared for my future and I always wish I could die before my parents. "

wrathful_acrimony,5btsmq,1478618521,I made this account to post this horrifically long open letter which I assume few will read or know what to do with,"To Whom it May Concern,

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not terribly clever, but I like to pretend I'm the smart one in the family. I think that's why my inability to reach any level of stability is so frustrating. I've also had issues. I was never great in school because I never did homework, as I assume many of you are also guilty of, but I was able to learn enough in class that exams were a breeze. My attendance is something that has declined over the years. It began when my stepfather started abusing and harassing me and my younger sister. He would chase us up the stairs and pinch our asses, or beat me for taking a shower as opposed to a bath. The world became structured and regimented, the opposite of the chaos that my mother and father bore us from. Before my mother remarried, her and my father fought day and night over custody. I have no memories of them together, only memories of my mother visiting me odd hours of the night to whisper fearful secrets of my father's anger. He would pick me up, and without fail, I would puke at least once on the car ride to his house, fearful of this monster whom I had been entrusted to for the next eight hours. He saw my fear, and when he was unable to sway me, he allowed me alone time with his countless video games and rock CDs. He showed me Alice and Chains, and gave me my first tape deck. We did puzzles, anything to get him to ease my anxiety. He was still a drunk, and he still lived in bad neighborhoods. He sold drugs and did coke right next to us. But he never hurt me, and he was always kind, understanding, and overprotective of me. Yet despite his behavior, my mother drove the fear into me each night. By the time I was six my stepfather had shown up and suddenly married my mother. It wasn't terrible at first, I had my father to be afraid of after all. The beatings only started when my mother became pregnant with my half brother. After his birth, the house was a war zone. He was a sickly child. My sister and I were under constant scrutiny. My mother was realizing how controlling and demanding her new husband was, so she started going out more. She opened a store, and spent long hours there. My stepfather was left alone with my sister and I more, but thankfully I was able to recognize his danger, and antagonized him with my rebellious nature. From ages seven to approximately thirteen I was able to direct his attention from my younger sister to me, and they only had physical altercations once in a while. I caught him hitting her once, and jumped to her defense. I yelled for him to stop hitting my sister, and he instantly jumped off, startled I had fought back. He pulled her up and laughed, claiming they were just playing and he hadn't hurt her. My sister, being maybe five or six, began to laugh too and told me not to worry; it was just a game. Years later, when he was striking me to the floor, he got on top of me and pinned me down, practically sitting on me, forcing me to look up at him. I saw a plastic butterfly net from my brother's bug catching kit, grabbed it, and began to swing at him. He threw me around after grabbing the net from me, laughing, and hit me until it snapped apart. Another some years later, he corned me in the kitchen after my mother and him had yet another fight, and she ran off slamming the door behind her. I grabbed a kitchen knife from the block and held it out, threatening him to stay away from me. He laughed and held out his hand, asking me to give the knife back. Being only twelve or so, I did as I was told, knowing full and well I didn't have the brass to stab him. He beat me then dragged me to two dinning room chairs, the kind with arm rests, and forced me to sit facing him, holding my arms down, our knees locked together. If I tried to move away, he pulled me back and yelled louder. The tenant we had in the basement apartment came upstairs after and threatened to call the police over the yelling. I had to go downstairs with him and tell her it was just yelling, and he didn't hurt me. After I lied, he pulled me into his car, pulled out money he'd be hoarding in his glove box, and gave me $100. He often took me to book stores and bought me books as a way of keeping me quiet, although I didn't understand it at the time. I just knew books and school were the only way to escape him and my mother.

&amp;nbsp;

When my mother did divorce him, in my seventh grade, I told her what he had done to me. She didn't believe it, even though she had witnessed and even participated once or twice, and then told me I deserved it for being such a smart mouth. I was the smart bookworm child, who didn't want to go outside and wanted to read. Yet I was deemed the devil in their eyes, so I became the devil. With nobody to punish me anymore, I started cutting when I missed school, when I didn't do homework, when I was mean to my sister, and so on. I still never snuck out, never did drugs until high school. I was accepted to a magnet program for intelligent students within the neighboring high school district. I was, after all, still smart. The first year I reinvented myself. I didn't want to be the sad bullied girl that nobody invited to parties anymore. I wanted to be cool. And I sort of became cool. I dyed my hair pink, I started smoking by tenth grade. Pot and drinking were a common release. Yet I was still bullied, so badly that I was hospitalized for three failed suicide attempts. A girl in my grade, my biggest tormentor, found out and told everyone I was there for eating disorders and killing myself because she ""stole my boyfriend."" Coming back to school after that was hell, and I skipped whole days and even sometimes a week at a time. My mother hated me. I started hanging with an older crowd, they were nice to me, and became my surrogate family. I even met a new, kind man who started to take interest in me. It felt like everything but home and school was turning around. Then one day, while I was out, my mother locked me out of the house. After arguing she agreed to take me to my grandparents, and instead she drove me to the ER. She had me forcibly committed. I was released, and she had an ambulance get me two hours later. She stole my grandfather's social security number to get me into a boarding school in Georgia. Thankfully, my father was able to (illegally) get me from the hospital. We were on the run for days before we were able to get him custody. Mom started to beat my little sister. Dad and I were too poor to afford groceries at times. Mt boyfriend's family started to grow weary of me and my constant issues. I was suddenly alone again. I dropped out of high school, I moved in with my friend and her family. I eventually moved out after a year, and now I am in college after getting my GED about six years ago. 


&amp;nbsp;

Now? I am reeling from a relationship where the man was, oddly enough, as emotionally abusive and controlling as my stepfather. I have gone back and forth on being okay. I will to call this an open letter because knowing what you know now, I want to ask some questions of the depression and suicideWatch communities. 

&amp;nbsp;

When you have responsibilities, how do you do them? How do you stop being disenchanted with life? How do you find the strength to care about anything anymore? How do you stop feeling like a devil? I don't want to become somebody where my anger and hatred consumes me, but slowly and surely I am becoming a wrathful, hateful person. I hate people. I don't trust them. I cannot leave my apartment without fear. In fact, I have not left it in nearly three weeks. I have failed out of college at this point and am here in name only. I have thought long and hard about suicide but find once again, I don't have the brass to do it myself. 

&amp;nbsp;

It started out slowly, and now here I am, wondering if maybe, when I had punished myself, if maybe that had given me the sense of equilibrium I needed in order to try and get work done. I can look down and continue to fail, for fear of leaving my only place of comfort and safety, or I can give up and be forcefully removed once I fail out of college, allowing me to reach the inevitability of my suicide. And don't say, ""Oh, but OP, there is so much you haven't seen or done yet, etc etc"" I'm well aware. I'm tired, reddit. I'm tired, and I know none of you care, and none of you will read this long god awful letter, but maybe, maybe one day, when something does see it, they'll know that I wasn't just another sad and sappy spoiled kid from America. I just want to feel good for once, I don't want this sadness and anger to consume me any longer. I am already to the point where I cannot leave my residence, what do you suppose is the next step? Utter committal? I cannot live like that. However, I also cannot keep sitting in the same chair everyday, smoking pot or drinking until I don't feel anything, stiffing the small anxiety attacks and cries of panic as deadlines come and go, and I allow myself to sink a little deeper into non-existence.

&amp;nbsp;

Wrathfully Yours,

I tried to kill myself earlier today. I tried to hang myself using bedsheets, but while the noose itself works well, I can't tie it tightly enough to the side of my elevated bed, so although the height is good enough to hang myself from, the ""rope"" slips a bit when I get into the noose and let go of my support, so my feet end up touching the floor anyway. I tried 3 times and I tried to force it a little to strangle myself but it's not good enough.

I don't feel regret for trying to kill myself, or sadness because of the people I was going to leave behind. I just feel pissed that it failed when I was so close for once. As you can see, I'm clearly not in the best state of mind. But I can aknowledge that it's not the right thing to do even if I really want to do it, so somebody please try to talk me out of it. I'm still focused on hanging myself and plan to order an actual rope from Amazon so it's getting close to being too late, and while I'd be more than happy about it it's certainly not the right thing to do and I can't reason myself out of it."

CorvetteCole,5cslpg,1479077310,"If you're feeling down, don't be afraid to share that with your loved ones.","I posted yesterday about my own struggles with depression after witness an 11 year old kid. I had always kept these feelings inside of me because I didn't want to burden the minds of those I loved. But on that post a redditor shared his story about how withholding his feelings from the person he loved caused them to leave him. That prompted me to, for the first time, fully open up to  the girl I loved and my family. I've gotten some really great messages of support and I'm doing a whole lot better now. The point of it all is, don't be afraid to let people who care about you know how you are feeling. As that same redditor said, ""If they truly love you no matter friend, family or SO they won't leave you bc of your thoughts and feelings."" I texted my girlfriend and got an amazing unexpected [response](http://imgur.com/a/4iqMM) (read bottom one first and don't notice my typos). Don't fear it. You underestimate the extent that people care about you.

TL;DR don't hide your own feelings and thoughts from those you love/love you because you are afraid of burdening them.

NeonVanilla,5c40kx,1478728609,Can you give me a reason to NOT kill myself?,"I'm 18, in college. 
Suicide has been taboo for hundreds of years, I think mainly because of religion. But now, more and more people kill themselves, and more and more people are seriously asking themselves if it really is a wrong thing to do. In some circumstances, suicide is even seen as heroic or good.

When you speak about your suicidal thoughts, people say it can get better. But they don't understand: we are powerless. We cannot change shit in this world. Everything is terrible right now in this world. People are absolute pieces of shit. I don't meet often persons that aren't stupid. And you can't change a political situation. You can't stop war. You can't stop hateful people.

I am nervous and anxious all the time, my mind is never at rest. My neuroticism is incredibely high, and there's nothing I can do about it. I lack self-confidence, and it seems I can't change that either. 

Please don't tell me there are people that care about me, I don't care about them. I am unable to engage in good relationships: for some reason, there are people that feel close to me, but I don't feeel the same. The only thing that may stop me from doing it is that I feel like an asshole because my mother paid so much money and to raise me and killing myself would be a waste of all of this. I'm not sure if this reason is good enough to stay alive. After all, if I'm uncomfortable living, why the hell would people stop me from killing myself? How can they know it will get better?

If you're reading this, can you give me a reason to stay alive?"

I'm fucking stressed out, cause I don't have the money for all of this. Not to mention eating is a bit hard on the good side of my mouth, cause the cracked filling is cutting into my to gue. Telling me to shut the fuck up doesn't help me much, and yelling only feeds my stress. 
Then telling me that I'm a constant pain in your side also didn't help much. Maybe I should just do something to have that pain constantly removed, as I see how much you fucking care about me. 
And yet, here you are unloading all of your own stress that you can't let go of.

Redmyreddit,5ao3tp,1478062221,SCRAMBLED MIND,"First let me start by introducing myself, I'm 15 years old and go to a boarding school, last year around mid October I stopped smoking Synthetic Weed for good after 9 months of everyday use. I was suspended because of it from school and the drug has ruined my brain, in the next paragraph I'm going to say what I feel like right now a year later and if you could include in your comments which parts are normal parts of puberty and which parts are not normal, also advice would be helpful ��.

So far I feel less detached from reality but still VERY detached, it's as if everything is fake, I can't socialise any more unless I analyse the persons body language and I'm still not good because I'm still learning how to socialise from scratch, it's as if I'm a baby. I feel no hope in life because my brain is so fucked, I have the sense that in my mid twenties I'll end up killing myself because I would have made it no where in life, I also have no empathy any more, what used to anger me doesn't, I'm emotionally flat in other words. I have conversations in my head with more than one conscious, also my personality can change based on the situation, basically I negotiate with the consciousness in my head and depending on the situation one can take over. People in my school are also psychopaths and keep using there body language to manipulate my subconscious into thinking bad things so I do what they want without them having to talk... This doesn't help either, I've replaced my sythetic weed hole with exercise, MDMA and alcohol. Also I can hear things in my head sometimes and be in a very bad mood randomly then in s good mood, I am also eating a lot more healthy to try detox. No one knows about this.

ImThroughHere,5aomwu,1478072056,It was cruel to create me.,"This is hell. Why was I born a fucking tranny? Why of all the things people can be, the potential they have to make something of themselves in this life, and the sheer number of them that get to be real women and real men, did I have to be born and die nothing but a ridiculous transsexual wretch that wishes it were female? Being stuck in this deformed male body is sick and cruel and I KNOW I would rather be dead. I hate that I can't gather the nerve to try and free myself again. I don't want anything in this life that is possible for a thing like me to have, not anything except to die soon and have it over with but it's so fucking difficult to force myself to do.

There's no place for me here. If I have to shove myself into a place and no one wants me there, then that place isn't mine to belong in at all. If I have to beg people to pretend to see me as a real woman, then I'm not. If the only place you can go without being unwelcome is the island of misfit girls where others like you are because there is no other place for them in the world, either, then you're not really a part of the world.

It doesn't matter what i want, or feel, or say, or do. I will never mean anything to anyone. I've never been loved, not even by my parents. My being a male-bodied abomination that wanted to be female disgusted them so they disowned me and evicted me when i was 14. I will never be loved, either. No woman who loves women would ever settle for a grotesque mistake, especially one with no future who doesn't even have an interest in continuing to live. In a better life, i might have been able to experience the things most real people experience, i might have had a community among women, or my own coptic people, or the lesbian/gay community. I understand why I'm not welcome. I understand why people delight in putting me in my place by reminding me i lack the anatomy of a real woman and that i'm only a poor imitation of the real thing at best, and by joking about how hideous and unconvincing and unfuckable and unsettling i am. I know why parents pull their children far away from me on the sidewalk even though i never even notice there's a child there until the parent yanks them to their other side.

I'm a symbol of everything everyone hates and belittles. I have to sell my body to afford shelter, food, and the medical care that at least keeps me from looking completely like a man. Even if i could save enough for a neovagina it won't be close to real. It won't make me whole or help me find a place here. I'd prefer it to a penis but in the end i would always be better off dead than living this shadow of a human life. I spend as much time as i can dreaming of being a real girl with a life worth living. i don't want to be me. no one would ever want to be me.

What's the point of sticking around? There's nothing for me here. I won't hurt anyone's feelings by just leaving it behind. i don't have close friends or a family, and what friends i do have are trans like me, though some of them look real and live fulfilling lives, the ones who aren't like that will understand, i hope. and i won't be around to suffer, to be ashamed of the monster i was born, and to be so indescribably sad that even my most basic dream could never have come true. And i won't be around to frighten, upset, and disgust people who are only trying to live the real lives they were given. it isn't their fault i was twisted and broken.

there's nothing here for me. there never was. all i need to do is be tough enough to finish myself off and i might find peace in death. there's only suffering and sorrow in my life."
Chaoraiser256,5e1blj,1479690688,"I am worthless trash,don't deserve love and probably gonna kill myself.","Hi there

I'm not very good with words but I'll try my best.

I feel worthless and unworthy of affection.

My family considers me a disappointment and among other things,believe that my depression is all my fault.

My classes are literally in the low grades with no chsnce of passing AND with my family telling me they'll kick me out if I don't pass saying that ""I've done this before multiple times,why are you still failing?"" or that it's my last chance,
And I cannot hold down a job,I don't have anywhere I can go,I have nothing.

I cannot talk to people at all due to severe depression,autism and whatever other conditions I have (I never tell people that I'm autistic because people usually are ashamed of me because of that but at this point I don't care anymore.)

I never feel happy no matter what I do anymore and have had suicide on my mind every day for the past few months,and have had many moments where I just start to cry and I never know why.

I have attempted suicide twice in my life using the same methods.(pills, and I frequently check which ones will do it too.)

All I have to live for is these two girls I know who I consider the best friends I have (irl at least) if I lose them then that's it. (And even then bad thoughts I have get worse as time goes on.)

I do not feel like I will live very long (at most not past January)

I don't want to ask for love cause I know I do not deserve it.

If anyone wants to talk that's fine, I do not expect it though.

TL:DR I am a worthless fuck up who doesn't deserve any love and won't make it through life for very long."
Afegddu,5cvbdl,1479119437,Last chances.,"I have been putting off death for more than a year.

I've been struggling with a particularly black depression since about June 2014, with no options for support or treatment despite every effort. Oh, there are ways, but they're as life-destroying as doing nothing. No option there unless I luck out and stumble on someone who can take me on and treat me in a way that doesn't render me worthless. Long story, too complicated.

Last year, August (well, July really, but it didn't really come to the front until August) I realised it was over. There's nothing more to do. I decided it would be over on Dec 23 or thereabouts. I made a plan, the whole thing made everything so much easier to deal with. In the end I actually pushed it back, decided New Year would be better.

Fuck it if life didn't toss me a thing that made me reschedule. But reschedule I did, and the new schedule actually seemed better - international business trip, plenty of scope for an ""accident"" that would ensure my family was taken care of. And the impact of me going away and not coming back might be easier, I thought.

Well, fuck it if a colleague didn't suddenly join and he wouldn't give me any space for the whole week. How could I do it without the time to get myself together?

So reschedule again to this August, so that things I was obligated to could be put out of the way for the sake of my conscience, but ironically I just couldn't get up the oomph to do it. One reason was the anticipation of a special event for my son that I thought I wanted to see before I went. I don't know, I guess I wanted to be in the pictures.

Now I regret everything. I regret not doing it when I first decided. I regret making such shitty plans that I couldn't even kill myself. I regret decisions I made years ago that led me here. I regret that time in 1989 when I was such a fuck up I failed an actual attempt. I regret being such a mess I could even think something like that when I have family depending on me.

I'm a worthless waste of air, but I obsess about how my sudden disappearance would cause things to grind to a halt. How fucking shameful is that? How disgusting is that ego? And how undeserved. Everything will stumble on regardless.

All I need is the will and the plan and the opportunity.

Last year I swore I wouldn't see 2016 unless it all changed. Nothing changed, but the prison got smarter. 
Well fuck it. I'm not sure I care about the obligations that have kept me alive and suffering through these years anymore.
No one cares anyway.

LickMyBloodyScrotum,5fn7tj,1480475201,I can't stop crying,"The last 7 years have done nothing but display how my life can only get worse. 

I've been hit by 6 cars. Lost 4 jobs. Lost the woman I love because of my increasing mental instability. Gotten a felony. Acquired substance issues. I'm homeless.  My parents are moving out of state next year. My transportation doesn't work, the guy I bought it from is ignoring me even though he owes me a spare engine. I have 4 misdemeanor charges to go to court for in the next month alone. 3 of them this week on my birthday.

All my stuff has been stolen. I'm sleeping on concrete and I have no blankets and it's in low 40s. I have no money for food until the 8th. My wallet is stolen so the only work I can get is manual labor and not even on a payroll because I don't have an I'd or social security card to prove who I am. 

I was called terrifyingly evil by the woman I asked to marry. I've been victim to hate crimes as I was beat on by five guys while in jail for being bisexual. 

I have no friends or family that can or is willing to help me.

I've started Self harming by cutting my arms. I constantly think of suicide and everyday I fight the urge to break down crying. Today I couldn't stop and I'm still sobbing as I type this.

I've been applying to jobs but no one wants to hire a felon. And even though I'd pass a background check in 2018, with current record, it's likely I'm going to get either a couple misdemeanors or 3 might be changed into a felony as are for same thing. 

Being hit by those 6 cars has left my body scarred and in pain. I have ptsd and anxiety from them. If a car turns just so in front of me while headlights are on I relive my first accident, which I was told should have killed me. 

I just want to be dead so my suffering will end. I've tried to keep my head up for so long but I just can't do it anymore. I'm broken. I've been warped from a kind sweet hearted man to a sadistic depressed asshole. 

My father is the only one in my family that even talks to me and he is going to another state. I'll never see him again. I have no one and nothing and I don't want to do this anymore."

I am 28, unemployed, have no money, living with my folks who help me out with my bills and expenses, i have chronic depression which ive suffered from all my life and since ive got older it just seems to be getting worse no matter how many different meds i try and how many therapists i see, nothing seems to make a difference.

I am a complete waste of space and just becoming a burden on my family. I am in debt from stupid mistakes and addictions and ive also wasted my parents hard earned cash which i had no right to and now they are threatning to kick me out and ban me from their bank accounts which they have every right too. I just want to die. Honestly ive had enough and dont think i can go on anymore. They will be better off without me ruining them, i could never repay them for everything they have done for me.

I have no friends, never had luck in dating and always been in and out of jobs and currently im long term unemployed on welfare and barely surviving. I cant even get work because i have no skills apart from retail and cant afford to go do courses/classes. I am also heavily tattooed in visible parts of my body which makes it hard to get work. 

So as you can see i have really fucked up my life and theres no way out this time, i cant go on anymore. I am a huge disappointment to myself and my family and they deserve better. Atleast when i die they can sell my stuff and get their money back and not have to worry about supporting their mentally fu**ed daughter anymore. "
ThrowingLifeAway944,5b9e1a,1478343190,I'm about done,"Do you know what the worst part is? These are all such spoilt little bitch problems it hurts. I sit here reading the stuff on this sub and I think fuck I don't even deserve to live if I can't take my situation and yet these guys are fighting on

I graduated in July and tried from July-September desperately to find a grad job where I was or close so that I could 1: be independent and 2: be closer to my boyfriend who I was temporarily living with at that point. No fucker would take me on because of my annoyingly useless degree and so I was forced to move back home to my mum in London.

Don't get me wrong I love my mum and I'm glad she's not on her own anymore now that I'm here, but keep reading I guess.

Just before I moved back to London my boyfriend said he hadn't enjoyed living with me and that he wasn't sure if we should stay together for reasons that aren't entirely relevant here. Post that I started having quiet crying fits and started to think about jumping off the car park in town or something. He and I have since sorted everything between us, but the suicidal thoughts are still there - the loss of independence, the constant rejection from jobs and grad schemes, the piece of shit supermarket job I got to save some money being the most boring, unchallenging thing I've done in my life, and the worry that that job's the be all and fucking end all if I don't get the job I'm interviewing for this Wednesday.

I keep bouncing from vaguely normal to ""I'm a worthless piece of shit and I want so badly to die."" I keep crying and I'm struggling to hide it from my mum (I don't really have that kind of relationship with her, it's weird), I'm trying to seek professional help but I have to wait for a month and sneak out to two workshops before I can even start getting treatment, and last night I maxed out my overdraft and had to borrow £150 from my boyfriend, and I've never been so ashamed of something I've done in the past, and I've done a lot.

I just don't even know anymore. I thought I was special, and that I'd at least measure up to what my sisters have done, but here I am, no friends in London, no confidence in my job prospects, barely able to see my boyfriend because of work time and distance (15 days to see him between now and March by my calculations) I'm just scared to be honest, every time I get low I seem to be worse than the last time and I feel like one day the thought of hurting my family and the people I care about just isn't going to be enough to stop me if this carries on.

I mean it's fucking ridiculous. There's nothing fucking wrong with me that isn't wrong with any other normal 20-something. And yet still all I want to do is lay down in front of a truck and hope he doesn't brake. Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck. I mean this is the fucking abridged version. FUCK"
kiri1234,5e2tu3,1479712648,nearing my end. posted in depression.,"TL|DR Suicidal. Explained what has probably built up and led into it. 
Hi guys. I have never told anyone what I'm about to type. I'm 23. Well, I'll just start of with my life, it has mainly been just my mother and I. I had a very distant relationship with my dad that affected me horribly as a child. I really just woke up one day after I graduated high school, and it doesn't affect me really at all since then. Even until this day, we talk, but he is not there for me. It's a very weird relationship because I feel like I don't know him at all. Well, with my mom. I was her only friend growing up. She loves me very much, and does everything for me. But she also at times has to have things her way, sometimes for things she thinks are in my best interest, but are what she wants. It sometimes puts a LOT of strain on our relationship, even as an adult there are many ways she tries to pressure me or make it difficult for me to make my own decisions. Since being a kid, I have always been told I'm an ""old soul"". It really has been much more of a curse than a blessing. I have always been very sensitive and deeply affected by people's actions. I feel everything so intensely. I always seem to be thinking differently than people I become friend's with. I had mostly one friend through high school, and knew a lot of others. I can never help but do anything and everything for someone like a friend. We were friends for 5 years, even after high school, when her friend that she had been friends with for awhile, told her it was me or her. Her other friend told me she didn't like me because she was her only best friend. It sounds stupid, but it devastated me because I thought the other friend was a horrible person. So the one person I had just completely forgot me. I have 2 friends now, but they seem to only reach out when they need for something. So I'm pretty much a loner. I just don't fit in anywhere. I also am a mom to a beautiful 3 year old. I've struggled through motherhood, my son was very colicky as a baby. Also, growing up and becoming a toddler, he is so sweet, but has behavioural issues and a speech delay. For years, I really can't go anywhere in public without a complete melt down and stares from a lot of people, screaming and crying. I was working a good job, recently, with my mom watching my son. I was paying her, and she agreed to watch him so I could save up enough to move out on my own. My son was kicked out a daycare I had saved up for, because he had a meltdown the 2nd day. He had never been in a daycare before. Then, my mom starts to tell me I need to quit my job. I had just gotten my first ever car. I started frantically searching for any special daycare I could find but things at a $1,000 dollars a month were far out of my price range. So I lost my job. Now my credit card payment has passed, and my car payment. My very first car. The one thing I worked for, so I could have a safe ride and air conditioning for my son and I (I'm in FL.) I love my son more than life. He has been what has kept me here. Now, as of recently, when he was at my mom's, he apparently had been so good with no meltdowns. It made me feel really horrible, because he cries for me, and only calls me by my name, and we have an incredible bond. Then I feel like somehow now, I trigger a bad behavior in him. I think it's because I've been to kind, I don't want to punish him besides raising my voice, because he has to be frustrated from not being able to articulate his feelings. He has medicaid, and all the same doctors I can go to say they can't offer therapy yet or diagnose him because he is too young, if he has any delay, or for behavioral issues. I love him beyond this world, when I think of any harm coming to him, any hardships, my heart breaks into a million pieces. But now I just start thinking everyone would be better off without me. I am going to lose my car, I was trying to get my credit really high so I could buy my son and I house, when I was done with school. I am a junior. I get scared almost everyday, swarmed with feelings that I serve no purpose here on earth. All my kindness I have offered, selflessness, my caring for animals and people unconditionally, that has really caused me more pain than good, is going to waste. That was was helped me along in life before my son came along. That even if I was depressed, I could still spread my kindness and love and help anyone I could. When that didn't work and my son came along, I tried being the best mother I could, and showing him how to care for people, and to be kind. Now he seems better off without me. My mother told me once, If I ever committed suicide, she would spit on my grave. She has always been one to try and instill fear by showing tough situations. I have always battled depression, and the feeling of hopelessness, but as of the past couple months, it's full blown escalated into scary thoughts. I think about just driving off a bridge when I'm driving on one. I sometimes think that one day, I could have my mom watch my son, and then leave and end it. I don't want at all to leave my son. I feel like I just cannot be the mother I wanted to be, I am a shell of a person that I feel like I don't have much more to give."

I can't take any anti-depressants or benzos because my mom doesn't want me to. I really don't care at all about the side effects, I just want this pain to go away.

I feel like I'm being crushed under the guilt of my mothers death. I have to be strong.  I have to pretend. When your world stops, everything else keeps going.. My mother died suddenly in July.  July 20th. 4 days after her 62nd birthday.  Me and my dad didn't find out until August 5th. The instant I found out, I wanted to die.  


My mother and I had a terrible relationship.  I believe she was a narcissist. She was a meth addict, she didn't care about me really,  only cared about what I could do for her. Her health was always rockey, in and out of the hospital 2-4 times a year.  Always for the same things.  This time was the same. But I was different.  Normally I would drive her to the hospital, wait till she got checked in and seem by a doctor, wait with her to be admitted, then leave when she let me.   Then I would visit her every day or every other day. This time was different though, I was holding a grudge. 

I was in the hospital for pneumonia.  I was there for about 7-8 days.  She never came to see me once. I figured she was just to sick to visit me herself. This was not the case.  I had done something last time she was in the hospital that wasn't to her liking so she didn't come to see me out of spite. I was fucking livid to say the least. I screamed at her that next time she was in the hospital i wasn't going to see her at all... well that bit me right in the ass... next time she went in.. She never came back... 


I visited her on her birthday though. I couldn't do that to her. She was still my mom. I still love her in some weird way... The last words I remember her saying w were... "" I was so scared because I really thought I was going to die this time..."" and she did... 4 days later... I hate myself every day.. if I hadn't been so petty... if I hadn't been so fucking petty.. I might have been there... no I know I would have been there... but she died alone... which was her biggest fear... I can't forgive myself... I just want to die to escape this crushing guilt... 


Everyone tells me to remember the happy times... but when they were so far and few between... it's hard...."

My relationship with my current friends and family are starting to crumble.  I've noticed it recently, but was in denial. But something happened today that made me realise just how socially awkward I am, haha. I can make friends ok, but I can never seem to keep them. Maybe im just over thinking or maybe I'm being a little oversensitive. I honestly don't feel anything for my girlfriend anymore. I don't know if it's because I'm depressed or not but I've always been kind of distant from my emotions. That really makes me sound like an edgelord buts it's the way i feel right now. I feel like nobody at work likes me, nobody ever laughs at my jokes and everybody ignores me. I work at an animal shelter, and I LOVE my job. I'm really good with the naughty dogs, but I'm not so good with naughty humans. I'm not a very good customer service rep... I feel like that's my downfall at work. My coworkers are probably tired of me not being alot of help with people, but cant fire me because I'm  ( I have a huge ego btw) the only non manager staff member who can properly handle animals. I'm always worried that people are saying things about me behind my back. And this week made me realise that alot of backstabbing is going around, some of it pointed towards me. It just kind of added onto an already not so fun week. Holy cow I'm sorry you read this far and thank you, people like you make a difference. Anyway I'm kind of dreading going to work now.

my_ship_has_sunk,5e37q1,1479720488,Not quite sure what keeps me going,"No idea what keeps me going sat this point. Drowning in debt. Drowning in self defeat and self hatred. People think I'm accomplished but it's truly a facade. I can hardly do the simplest of tasks these days like getting out of bed, brushing my teeth, having a conversation with another human being... there is nothing in life that stands as even a symbol of joy. I've replaced numerous addictions with countless others; not just substance related. I'm a shit show. Each time anyone says ""but you've done_____ or you doing ___ (insert supposedly great thing), etc. I think if only u knew, if only you knew that it doesn't always get better and in my case each of those moments where people have said, ""see! ___ happened/is happening"" to imply something positive in reality it is just a sign of things getting worse and worse. I have no friends. Ha. That's a joke what the fuck is a friend anyways. I reveal too much EVERY TIME and scare them all away. Those things that I think momentarily make me proud of myself or happy or whatever never actually exist. I'm a fucking failure. 

The ONLY really I've lasted this long is I know how much pain I would be putting my family in if I died. Not to mention my extreme debt would fall onto them.  I feel trapped. I feel like there is no way out. I've tried to fix shit. I've tried other paths. I've tried changing whatever is making me unhappy. I've tried meds and therapists. In reality we are each just a fucking speck on this giant canvas of the universe that really doesn't matter one bit except that we provide fertilizer to plants when we are dead or carbon to the environment or whatever. 
Nothing works. Since hotlines. Turning to my significant other. (That def makes it worse). Turning to my animals for comfort. Sleeping. Meditation. Not sleeping. Opening up. It's all just fucked. I'm just fucking worthless and over it. As much as I hate the thought of hurting those who care like my family I think sometimes that the pain I am experiencing is so fuckjng excruciating that I m not sure I can be selfless enough to bear it any more. If you read all of this, thank you. I'm just going to sit here in my self loathing and continue to fail and suffocate under the weight of all I need to be doing but can't bring myself to do. 
All day at least 100 times per day I think, "" I wish I was dead""
Hospitals can't help bc it's like what are they gonna do? Lock me up for a bit until I'm over the momentary urge to hurt myself? Fuck that. It's not momentary. It's not fleeting. It's not circumstantial. It's every minute of every goddamn day. What are my options? I've thought through them all including ending it but none seem to make sense or seem to offer a solution and even that is terribly painful to realize. I hope I suffer from some freak accident or a massive heart attack or something and then I won't be the one guilty for making that decision. It'll just be fuckjng over. I'm over it. I have been over it. I'm just FUCKING trapped. "

I’m not trying to impress them  


Just give the wrong impression  


Prevent those whispers, but no success

Just sink motionless to the bottom of the ocean

Jacob_Vaults,5bbbbg,1478370133,I'm currently in the hospital.,"Edit: Title should really say I'm in the ""ER.""

Well, I tried to kill myself by overdosing on my insulin (type 1 diabetic) and after about 30 minutes I felt like complete and total shit because of hypoglycemia so I called 911.

Now typing this as I sit in emergency care, eating a tuna sandwich. 

I don't know why I did it. I'm 100% positive part of me did this for attention. I used a means of suicide that I could back out of if I wanted to, that way people would feel sorry for me after they heard I ""attempted.""

I don't know why I'm like this. I'm such a piece of shit. Burdening everyone else with my depression for whatever emotional gain I think it might give me. 

But the ironic truth is that I did really want to die. Like almost everyone one of us here, I hate life.

I'm just too scared to actually do it. Do it myself, that is. I don't fear death at all. Not one bit. But I fear dying, and I'm too weak to do it myself.

So, I'm gonna lay here on this hospital bed and wait. Probably going to end up having to go to another psychiatric hospital (it'll be my second time).

I'm starting to regret calling 9/11 though. I should've just let myself die. Nothing any of the paramedics or doctors said has helped at all. ""Don't hurt yourself, that's a dumb thing to do."" ""Come on man, you've got your whole life ahead of you."" And even, ""You can't be doing stupid stuff like this,"" from one of the people that were with me in the ambulance. 

You think I don't fucking know that?

Also, I don't want to go to a hospital again.

I just feel like I'm going to end up attempting again. Maybe it's because it was literally only a couple of hours ago, but I don't feel any sort of the relief other people say they have when they survive an attempt. I don't feel just completely joyous to actually be alive. I honestly wish I didn't do anything and died."
OxygenTransformed,5cfxxq,1478887987,Why can't I die?,"I have suffered from OCD, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and clinical depression since I was a very young child. The first time I considered suicide I was 11 years old. I was being viciously bullied at school and none of the adults were doing a damn thing. (My narcissistic mother didn't exactly help either, responding to my suicide threat by threatening to commit suicide herself if I did it, but that's beside the point here.)

I'm 26 now. I have not wanted to live, not just passively accepted being alive but actually wanted to *live*, for 15 years. Yes, I'm on medication and have tried cognitive behavioral therapy. Those things have helped in the sense that I'm not actively trying to kill myself every time something goes wrong, but I'm still not passionate about life. I don't feel my presence on this earth is doing any good for anyone. If I were to die of some other cause, I'd welcome it.

This Wednesday I had a chance. And I missed it, all because of a fucking seatbelt.

I'll be the first to admit that I'm a terrible driver. In the five years since I got my license (yeah, I was a late bloomer in that regard), I've been in three fender benders. On Wednesday morning I was distracted by something on the side of the road, not important what, and ended up slamming the passenger side of my vehicle into the driver's side of a parked truck. The truck didn't actually take much damage, but my front passenger side was completely wrecked. I could easily have flown through the windshield and died.

I walked away from the wreckage with a bruise on my neck from hitting the headrest, a sore knee from banging it on the dashboard, and a good-sized red mark on my chest from the seatbelt. The seatbelt that, according to the EMTs who came to check me for spinal injuries, probably saved me from dying or breaking my spine.

I've spent the past three days wondering why I shouldn't finish what my stupidity started. I still owe almost $4000 on that car, and I doubt it's fixable. I can't afford two car payments on my salary, especially with the insurance surcharge I'm sure I'll incur. There are probably plenty of people who, given my driving record, think I should die anyway and make the roads safer for everyone else. 

Add to that the fact that I'm 26, unmarried, and haven't dated since college. I'm gay in an area where most people aren't overtly homophobic, but tacitly don't ""agree with my lifestyle"" (what lifestyle, perpetual chastity)? I'm addicted to marijuana because that and Ativan are the only things that calm me the fuck down, and pot is less physically addictive so I default to that. Before switching to pot, I was a borderline alcoholic. I'm not even going to talk about the election but I'm pretty sure you can all guess how I feel about the new President. Can you see why I don't find much value in this life?

About the only thing I feel any shred of happiness about is my NaNoWriMo project. I don't want to go into too much detail since this sub isn't for that, but I think the plot I have in mind is pretty good and I've been enjoying writing it, as much as I can still enjoy anything. That said, I'm not sure finishing a badly-written novel about a magic lesbian neurologist is worth living for. "

I even began working on piano and guitar just to take one step further in becoming a singer but now i feel like theres no point. Recently i did an audition for this uni that i really wanted to go to. Instead of being offered a bachelor, i was offered a diploma. But I know my parents would be upset and I, myself was so let down and disappointed in what I got. I havent even told them about what i got because I know they are going to be disappointed. I just dont have the energy to talk to my parents and just reply with one words because Im so tired and sad all the time but my mum doesnt understand and yells at me for being selfish and not caring about her. Its just my mind is going crazy, I want to achieve my dreams but its so hard. At that uni they said I had a nice tone/good voice but i lacked breathing control and vocal control and intonation. I called them back asking whether i could still do Bachelors instead of diploma and desperately asked them and now they are offering me a second shot of auditions with the head teacher of that department. I really appreciate that they are giving me a second chance but now i feel so useless and so tired of trying so hard to achieve my dreams because every time i try singing to someone my anxiety gets in the way and i stuff up. I just dont know what to do. No matter how hard I try to be brave and confident to sing to someone, I keep lacking the ability to display my full potential because Im always so scared. Recently I keep having self doubts on whether i can even become a singer and just kind of want to give up and just leave this stupid world because its so hard. 
edit: i would appreciate it if i have someone to chat with... feelin really loney and tired and just hopeless "
r3m1e,5c427z,1478729084,I'm ready to go.,"I'm so tierd of living like this, depression is killing me. I'm ready to pass away, I'm really close to end it all now. I'm feeling sad everyday and all the time, it hurts."
ThanosisKing,5bvx4d,1478638919,Why shouldn't I kill myself?,"I keep asking myself this question and I keep coming up empty for answers. I have a job that doesn't want to give me anywhere near enough hours to live on, they stick me in the back and completely forget about me, and the only time someone does talk to me it's to try and get me to cover for someone because they know I'm desperate for hours.

I've tried to find another job but my last manager, who frequently went into work drunk, fired me and refused to let me access my information during one of his many drunk days. Nobody around here wants to hire a 30 year old who got fired from a grocery job. It took 5 months to find my current job and like I said above it has been hell.

I haven't been so much as touched by another person in over 2.5 years. The very few friends that I do have are all moving away. I can't find anyone else my age around here. All the MeetUp groups that have anything to do with things I like to do are all at least an hour away, which is useless cause I have no money to keep traveling that far.

I'm also completely socially inept, to such a degree that my doctors suspect Asperger's. I try to watch and learn how people who are friends interact but when I try something similar I only end up pissing people off. When I try to act on instinct socially I piss people off.

So why shouldn't I kill myself?"
asunthatrises,5bw1i7,1478640123,Just need somebody to listen for a while,"As the days go forward, I can feel myself slipping further into depression. I've had a history of mental health issues in the past and over the last few years, things were great. I had some sporadic bouts of anxiety, but usually because of temporary stress in my life. I've mostly been content.

More recently though, I have found myself falling deeper into a hole from which I feel I can't escape. I've been seriously depressed in the past, but I thought I'd left that behind me. But now it's come back worse than ever.

The positive thing is, I know I'm depressed. And because I've been depressed before, I can at least sometimes tell myself it will be temporary. The negative thing is I feel I have no options to get out of it. That this time maybe it won't go away.

Part of what's lead to my being depressed is that I moved to America around 6 months ago to marry my wife. This should have been an amazing event for me, but it wasn't. We mostly married to stay together, so didn't have a real ceremony - we wanted to save money. My family wasn't even there. 

In the six months since, I've been unable to work due to visa restrictions. I've just been living with my wife and her parents. I had no drivers license (or way to get one) so have been incredibly isolated. I've had to rely on lifts from her family and have lost all my independence which has made my self-esteem plummet.

Added to this is the knowledge that I've left my home (UK) behind and I know that it'll be a long time before I go back. I miss it a lot and hate where I live in America, but currently we have no funds to move. I thought I'd be happy to give up many of the things I love about the UK to be with my wife. But some days I feel like I've made a huge mistake. That I've sacrificed too much.

Most recently, I have been granted work authorization, so I've started to look for a job. The trouble is, I'm still learning to drive, so still need to rely on my wife and her family for transport. All of the jobs have bad pay and despite quite a good resume, I feel like I'm destined to do similar jobs to those that I've done in the past. Work that I hated.

I'm convinced that there is nothing positive left in my future. Just a job I hate, not making enough money to move out with my wife. Never finding independence again. I keep thinking that once I do get a job, I won't get enough holiday time to ever go back home. That something might happen at home and I may never get to see my mother again. 

My savings are almost gone and soon I'll have to take any job I can find. I feel like a complete failure. And I just feel like there's little chance of me being happy. 

The longer this goes on, the harder life becomes. The problems I have feel bigger every day, though they don't change in size. The solutions don't seem to exist. I feel like I am trapped in my life. Destined to be unhappy. I just can't picture any positive outcome to me life from my present circumstances.

And I feel lonely. I literally left everything behind in the UK and in the USA I have nothing. I've tried to talk to my wife, but she doesn't know what to say. I can't make friends without having my wife drive me some place and now that my money is running low I feel guilt about spending on things like going out.

The more this goes on, the more I think about suicide. It's a bad habit more than anything. I just do it automatically. I'm not sure I'd ever follow through with it. But that doesn't matter. What matters is I feel so hopeless that I believe that to be a rational option.

I don't know. I feel like there's very little reason to live apart from my wife. But then I also feel most days that she'd be better off without me. Like I am a burden.

Sorry, there's a lot of self-pity here, but mostly I try to keep this stuff to myself! I'd happily go to see a therapist or counsellor but obviously that would cost money which I'm currently running low on. Another reason to feel angry and sad.

Anyhow. I hope somebody can understand at least."

 I have lost everything. I lost my son, due to his ungrateful mother and i am not allowed to see him due to her. I lost the girl who I truly loved, not my sons mother. I lost my car in a car crash, when some one hit me . I am loosing my parents to sickness.

I have nothing left, no energy, nothing is worth fighting for anymore. Everything is gonna end either way , might as well speed up time myself and die already. 

I wouldn't dare speak to a therapist because of the consequences, neither to anyone I know.

Throwaway39466,5djzf8,1479435575,Need some help in MS/LA...,"I'm male, and I live around the Mississippi/Lousiana border near Slidell, and I don't know what to do really...


To start off, I've had minor depression issues on and off for 14 years, but this year it culminated in me actually needing to get meds to help control it, same with anxiety. I've been on the meds for 11 months and I'm in worse shape than in January. Recently, it's become amplified infinitely, due to my wife out of the blue wanting to split up due to a few 'mishaps' in our relationship over the years. I was completely blindsided by this, and she refuses to talk it over, do couples therapy. I'm addicted to her, and we've been together since mid-2005, before I turned 15, and we have 4 kids together, 2 who live with us (2 were adopted out early on in our relationship)


Due to all this, I've been at wits end, considering downing every bottle of pills I can find, and even had the cops and e-squad called on me earlier this week, and I lied to them about me bordering on taking all the pills or not. I don't even want to be in this shape due to my kids. It pains me enough just to sit alone, bawling my eyes out and having to tell my kids to give me a few minutes. 


I saw a counselor on Monday, and she said that I need to work on myself, and throughout my life, I've been told I'm too self-centered, so I have a hard time even doing things for myself anymore, and for psychiatric help, I was told the two closest places earliest I could get in would be three and five months. I've been teetering on self-committment, but I'm worried that something like that could be leveraged against me to keep me from seeing my kids in the future...

Super_Sand_Lesbian_1,5ah3ac,1477972069,"I was having a good weekend, but it all fell apart today because I got inside of my own head","Every week, I inch closer and closer to truly wanting to kill myself, as my opinion on myself just lessens every day, and all of the good days I have are not deserved.

This past Saturday, I had probably the most enjoyable night I've had in well over a month. I played in my orchestra club, hung out with friends at a Halloween party, and super drunk. It was great fun.

Yesterday, I spent all day getting ripped apart by my professor for not getting some stuff done for a class I have been assisting him in, and then catching up on that work for hours.

Today, I worked with the other assistants for the course on stuff, then proceeded to have a panic attack and dip back into depression because I feel like a dumbass failure for having a 3.4 GPA in a CS major who will never achieve anything because he also sucks at technical interviews and truly knows absolutely nothing and will never be valuable to an employer or company that actually matters in the world.

Then I proceeded to upset my mother by telling her my feelings and making her worry about me. I'm going home to see her and the rest of my family so it'll be interesting to see how she reacts in person. I haven't told my parents that I've been suicidal. 

I feel like I've ruined my life exclusively because of my GPA being not outstanding, and this semester has been such a bitch that it's bound to stay the same or dip just a little, which due to my irrational way of thinking, is bound do drive me fucking insane. 

I want to kill myself. I'm such a dumb, useless sack of shit who makes the same mistakes over and over again because of overconfidence and hubris. I can't do anything right. Everything bad that ever happens to me is my fault, I have no one to blame but myself.

If I don't get an A on my most recent programming project that I put hours of work into last week and made sure it's 100% right, that will probably be the last straw and I'll just end it. I'll feel so incompetent and hopeless because I made such a simple mistake that none of my peers made.

I've been keeping a knife on my desk for weeks now, but I think the bridge close to my apartment building will be good enough.

Why am I even bothering to study for another quiz right now. Fuck it."

It also feels like I'm constantly reliving the past and it's coming back and happening now. If I think hard the past changes and the connections in the present change as well. I know this is not normal. 

I don't think I'm a conscious being. I simply exist because that's the natural order. I will eventually stop existing and I don't think things will be much different. I think it might be comforting to go back to being matter that isn't self-aware. 

This started when I took acid a few years ago. I can't seem to change it now. I'm not sure what to do. I can function in society and have lots of friends. I don't know what to tell a therapist. I'll appear normal to them, so what's the point? I mostly want to be able to label what I'm going through, so I can learn to manage it.

I worked at Macys for 9 years  in a call center environment.  After my job closed, i had been so depressed to where i just don't want to get off the couch and wrapped up in a blanket in tears.  I had applied for several jobs online as a call center representative, had phone and in person interviews and got a bunch of doors slammed in my face because i appear to alot of these prospective employers as this ugly...hideously twisted faced...physically awkward...dumpy.. creepy-looking..black woman who appeared to them being misunderstood as mentally retarded.
The last job assighnment was at express scripts sent by kelly service and that trainer didnt like me since the first time.  they secretly was talking about me behind my back figuring out a plan to get rid of me because i am so ugly and retarded-looking.  I found out last Friday evening when i spoke to the kelly recruter. Express Scripts told them i was not able to catch on and comprehend. I had trouble with my password.. I did not pass the test. I was told that i can retake the test  again but the trainer was working against me, and my looks made them unconfortable.  Monday tried to call the recruter at kelly service and she did not accept my calls nor responded to my messages.  Before i worked at the raviloi factory where is was being overworked and treated like cattle.  i had to stand on my feet all day and cant sit down.  That is called hazing.  Befor that was send on a job assighnment at the Hospital and was being worked against and turned down. the Hosptial came up with an excuse to turn me down because i need more computer skills.  I was actually being treated differntly than other temps.  They treated me like a criminal when i apply for these jobs. The managers look at me like a dog when i come in the room, no one was talking to nor introduced themselves to me.  They singled me out to be treated differntly than other employers.  When i get up and walk i was being taunted by other workers at the company.  I was not being given a kind word, the bosses was nasty and unfriendly towards me personally but at the same time smile  and more conversationsal with other workers like at Wheelchair professionals.  Applied for other jobs online and got alot of response:"" Thank you for apllying but you are not selected, and we decide to go futher with other candidates""  Now this Year 2016 is almost over with and i still dont have a Steady job and my unemployment is about to run out.  If this keeps on i am going to have more problems.  when i am in this situation; i would end up being evicted form my apartment and be foreced to live in the streets on skid row as a bag lady in the streets pushing a shopping cart and eating out of trashcans.  While my 15 year old son in being taken away from me, in some foster care system.  Yes alot of hiring managers is just being mead to me , not treating me fairly when it comes to training, they dont trust me based on my physical appearance.  They see me with someone with a disability based on my looks and they dont trust me.  I have been dumped on all my life ever since birth.  There has been some days that i wish i could go to sleep and never wake up again.  According to the managers at these companies i had applied for picture me as someone with mental retardation base on my looks.  I appear to them as creepy...ugly... repulsive to look at.. physically awkward.. who walk and talk funny.  They dont care about my situation as being a single mother who is trying to support herself and take care of a child with special needs.  I look at my son and feel so sad because i want to do more for  him. Like buy him new cloths and shoes.  I have been mistreated all my life ever since i was a baby...
because of the way i look.  Both Parents really didn't want me.  Always expressed alot of shame, embarasment  and hostility towards me.  they mocked me about how i turned out at birth. they told other people and family members why they stop having kids after is was born. Here is the follwomg reason; When im present they cover up their insult when they said:' Their blood type dont match"" and When i am not present, They tell other people they dont want two ill-formed babies... they dont want it to turn out like me or worse.  The doctor advised them to stop having children after i was born because their blood types don't match, and suggest to dump me in a snake pit.. the human warehouse.. the State Hospital because i am only going to a useless drain on society.  Didn't take that many baby pictures of me, what was i hidden in the closet because the parents dont want nobody to see me. I was being denied education in early child hood and  wrongly dumped in special education classes for the mentally retarded. It like everyone has colored me Garbage based on my physical appearance.  i had started saying nobody like me when i was 8 years old in the third grade, i was being rejected when My Teacher tried to flunk me in the thrid grade.  Nobody want to see me succeed and it is all because these people dont like my looks and they dont trust me.  Started having thought of Suicide at the age of 11 in the sixth Grade.  Started telling alot of people in the neighborhood that i want to commit suicide when i was in the seventh Grade. Wrote al lot of notes to teachers in grammer school that i wanted to kill myself because i have been mistreated all my life. and bullied all the time.  I was persecuted  as a teenager and called ugly all the time. Persecuted all the time by a lot  of dudes and called ugly.. never was popular and the Teachers was trying to flunk me and give me the lowest grades. Engaged other students to abuse and make fun of me. The Teachers was always rejecting me when i brough to abuse to their attention. Sat up there in class watching my class mates bully me and did nothing about it. The kids was throwing objects at me, wrote a threating note""you need to be put away in a crazy house. "" also in the letter they threatend to beat me up and i have a big nose and very goofy-looking.  Told school officials and i was ignored, and they kept their doors locked when i needed to see them.  Giving me real nasty looks for no reason.  Some teachers mocked me when i shared my feelings and concerns to them,It sounded like they are so desperate to say how they really feel about me.  It was just like twisting my arm when this Teacher made this comment"" I am not trying to insult you but you look like a sick dog.""

But if you dig deep enough to find out more about me, I suffer from a strong case of bipolar disorder, specially the depression state.

My girlfriend left me after 2 and a half years of relationship. This has removed the ground beneath me. I have done everything I could for her during this time and now I see myself alone and with my heart completely shattered.

I've been flirting with suicide for some time, but she was a reason for me to hold my ground everyday. Now that I've lost my reason to live, the flirting has become almost like a marriage and I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel.

One thing is for sure though, things will end.

I'm sorry if you're reading this and it made you depressed as well, that wasn't my intention at all."
lialz,5d8ps1,1479295717,It's either everything at once or nothing at all. (20F),"This is going to be quite long, I’m sorry. 
I don't know if this is all going to make sense, but I just need to let this out now while I can. I'll try to be as coherent as possible, but I apologise if nothing makes sense at all. 

As the title suggests, I either feel everything at once or nothing at all. I don't know how to describe what I mean by ""everything"" but basically everything feels so intense and it's like experiencing every emotion all at once. And then suddenly everything shifts from colourful to nothing. I feel so numb and everything seems to be so static. This drop from one pole to another is so frustrating and tiring. 

I've always been sad growing up. I only know my dad through pictures as he passed away in a car accident when I was young. It was my fault though. I was with him in the car. If i wasn't the ill child I am, or if I simply wasn't born, he'd still be here in this world. I always think about how I never got the chance to tell my dad that I loved him and to go out with him. Everyday I think about my life if he was around. His death affected my family so intensely. 

My relationship with my mum used to be quite good until she remarried. I was really happy that she was going to have a partner to be with and for the fact that I still somehow get to experience what it’s like to have a father. Her husband was really nice to use and he treated us like his own. Until they had their own child, that is. I completely understand that naturally, he would love his child more than us because obviously, we aren’t related to him. I was starting to feel like family isn’t just about blood. But unfortunately, it is to her husband. All their attention were starting to shift to our step brother. Don’t get me wrong, I love my step brother and I am still close to him right now. I’d understand if you think I’m just a selfish bitch here, but my own mother forgot about us. She treated us like servants. 
She wasn’t too hard on my brother, but she used to scream at me for being a “lazy, selfish retard” when I was ill. I suffer from cystic fibrosis and some other stuff related to it so being ill was a given already. lol. I literally thought she was going to kill me at one point when she was so furious at me she started hitting my head against the wall. I still remember evert bit of that event and I still have dreams about my mum coming after me to kill me. 
Despite her anger towards me though, she’d still pay for my medical bills so I’m thankful for that. But what was worst is that my brother was showing serious symptoms of brain tumour but she didn’t do anything about. We only found out about it when he had a stroke at my uncle’s place. If it happened at my mum’s, he probably didn’t even get the chance to fight. Turns our his cancer had metastasised to his lung when we found out. He passed away eight months after his diagnosis. It really shattered me when he died. He was such a talented 18 year old who had so much to expect in the future. After his death, my uncle and his wife offered to take me in and ever since, I’ve been living with them. 

Looking back at time, I feel like I was coping quite well with my emotions until my boyfriend died 3 years ago. I met him a few after my brother’s death at hospital. He too had cancer and I really didn’t want to lose anyone anymore but we started seeing each other even when we weren’t in hospital. He was there for me whenever I needed him. He'd make sure if I've taken my medication and he always reminded my to eat and drink. I know this kind of sounds like TFIOS but my relationship with him was basically like that film. 
I was really afraid to enter a relationship as I have borderline personality disorder and I’m bipolar as well. You can imagine how hard it is to be with a person like that. But he didn’t leave when I told him about it and stayed with me despite the awful things I’ve said to him. He was just beyond amazing. 

Although I’ve had thoughts of suicide before my brother passed away, it’s become more intense especially after my boyfriend passed away. I tried a few times and I got really close but it just left me in a coma for a few days. It just made everything worse especially after my second attempt, my psychiatrist only gives me medication for a week, my aunt checks on me every fucking hour just to check if I haven’t cut myself and if I’m still alive. Everything is so controlled around me. I feel so trapped in my mind and in my surroundings. I want to live, but I don’t want to live. I want to feel better, but these thoughts are now my comfort zone. All of these dilemmas are too hard for me to weigh. I can neither choose to live or die as my life is meant to be shorter than everyone else. I can’t deal with the physical torment and mental torment I go through everyday. My body is never at peace and so is my mind. I can’t even get a lung transplant even if I wanted to since I have a few mental illnesses and because I’ve attempted suicide a couple of times. A part of me wants another chance to live, but I’m not “reliable” enough. Sometimes, I feel like my mind is so peaceful and even feel like I want to live, but then it’s just another bipolar cycle. I become depressed as hell right after and just makes me want to kill myself, but just too depressed to even do something about it. It's been really hard lately and my aunt makes a big deal out of everything like staring at a knife before dinner. 
Tons of people have lectured me about how it’s so wrong to commit suicide and that I should learn how to find worth in my life. But I don’t get it. I’m just running towards death everyday and at twenty, I’ve lived the average life expectancy of CF patients. Everyday that passes, a part of my body is deteriorating. Why should someone who’s capable of ending their life from be expected to carry on in an extremely suffering capacity, slowing getting worse, hoping their life to be taken away, live? I’ve seen others who battle CF pass away. It’s pure torture. Why on earth is suicide a “crime” in our “modern” society?

I know this is all just a long word vomit, but I don’t care if no one reads it. Thank you so much though if you did. I just wanted to write it out and feel like someone’s listening. "

FloodedCrisis,5foyud,1480502580,I am hurt.,"Ignored just like any other person who might feel like me. Try telling this to anyone who doesn't care. I just live with heart aches and the urge to harm myself without telling people exactly how I feel because of ignorant people. I have nobody that loves or cares about me. The best thing for me is to die and cry while doing it because I feel so worthless. I have never cried until tonight because I know I'm serious about taking my life. I was a good person who has been hurt. I've been abused, I'm suffering with traumatic memories of it, I'm homeless, but in the process of losing my job and it's bad enough I have no confidence and low self esteem. I'm dealing with someone who I trusted and was suppose to get married to that left me and lied about cheating on me just to get out of our 2 year relationship and I dedicated my life and time to her and her last words in regard to my well being was ""I don't care"". I'm pathetic and there is nothing that will change that. You live pathetic, you die pathetic and I'm a worthless piece of shit with no future and nobody will ever, EVER give a shit about me when I'm dead. R.i.p. to myself since I've already planned this out and I'm wasting little time just typing this and need to proceed with my final curtain.

I have a plan. I think about it all the time. I need help. I've told my husband but he thinks he can ""fix"" my sadness by distracting me. No one takes me seriously and I'm scared that I'll give in. I can't hold on much longer. "

I tried telling my friend that I'll be leaving soon but he doesn't believe me because I'm not that kind of person , they all see me as this happy person but I'm not , not ever not even once. I don't know when this started , this feeling of overwhelming emptiness which shuts me down , I thought I can handle it but I can't. misery has remained a misery. I don't want this life , I'm not interested. I'm 100% sure that I'm gonna do it , I've already prepared everything I don't know what's out there or if there's something out there. maybe hell for people like me or nothing. I'm both excited and terrified but every time I think of it , it makes me smile. at least I won't feel this whatever emotions I'm feeling that's driving me insane and I won't go through this ever again. I didn't experience any forms of abuse in my life , I grew up normal my family is far from perfect but it's okay and they're going to be okay even without me. I'm not sure if I should write them a letter , should I ? However I've been spending more time with them and remembering what they all look and sound like , I also spent sometime with my closest friends. I tried so hard to think about the future , my future things like getring married , travelling and even read inspirational stories motivate myself to live but all those time I was fooling myself thinking everything will be okay because it's not and it won't be maybe it works for other people but not for me. maybe I was made for this and there was no avoiding it. it's time to go and let go. I have a few days left , I was thinking about writing letters to my parents and siblings but I'm not sure , I don't want them to feel sad or angry because what I'm doing is going to make me happy and I hope they'll be happy for me too , I love them. I know they'll be sad and angry at least for quite sometime but they'll soon forget me we're all gonna die someday mine just got a little early.

tastetheramb0,5cfs14,1478886272,I attempted suicide this week and am now terrified of myself,"For the past year or so, I have been struggling with depression and cutting myself whenever I feel overwhelmed but this Wednesday I went over the edge. Since I'm a senior in college and trying desperately hard to make sure I graduate, I have felt more stress than usual. Like instead of cutting every now and then I do it at least once week and I even took to pulling my hair out because I couldn't find anything sufficient to hurt myself with. Well, Wednesday something happened that set me behind two weeks and I lost it. I immediately felt so overwhelmed that I needed to check out and so I tried to asphyxiate myself. If I hadn't been able to untie the rope I would have died. And now for the past two days I've just been thinking ""What if?"" and feeling so terribly guilty and terrified at myself and what I would have made my family, specifically my mother, go through. 

I'm going to counseling Tuesday (that was the soonest I can get an appointment), but before then what can I do to help ease the terror and guilt? "
AcidHijoxizmo,5bcmv5,1478385801,I was admitted into the Hospital last night for the first time.,"I've been dealing with depression and anxiety since the beginning of 2014. Yesterday afternoon I was meeting with my counsellor when we made the decision together that my suicidal ideations were getting worse and dangerous. I'm afraid that I might compulsively kill myself, like I sometimes compulsively self harm. I have multiple plans and when I'm alone during the week I feel like I can't trust myself. One ambulance trip later and 7 hours of waiting in the ER and the psychiatrist admitted me for the weekend. They gave me 50mg of seroquel and I actually got a full nights sleep for the first time in weeks. I'm just laying in my bed browsing reddit and watching netflix on my phone. If I stop to think about my life I usually get a panic attack or just uncontrollably sob. Can anyone help distract me?"

I'm a horrible person, I always lie, I only have one friend who I feel I can talk to about my problems and I just got really pissed at her a few hours ago because she was talking about how I'm covered in scars. Life just isn't for me, even if I won't be depressed or anxious or bipolar or borderline or ednos or self harming forever, it won't change the fact that life just isn't for me. I just have no ability to deal with having to work and be a good person and deal with life, I'm simply too weak. Some people just aren't cut out for living, and I'm one of them.

But you have no idea. You have jobs, or friends, or very likely *some* family. I haven't spoken to anyone but a cashier for weeks. 

People just don't survive on their own. Nobody would miss me or care if I died, nobody would care if I did anything tomorrow. I may as well not exist. Somebody give me a good reason to keep going that isn't completely retarded. "

I try to stay busy, avoid things that make me think of him, but I feel empty inside. I am constantly fighting off tears and when these large pockets of emptiness hit me, they hit me hard. I'm left with no spark to life and no meaning. I have lost direction in life. I don't even know what I want for the future anymore. I want him to come back, like he did twice before, but I'm slowly starting to realize that's it's really over this time. He doesn't want me anymore and I don't know how to cope with that. I feel like I'm forcing myself to keep moving forwards everyday. I'm so lost."
ifimgoneimnothere,5czt0h,1479173408,Gone in a couple months,"Can somebody try to talk me out of it? I've had my dream career for about fifteen years now and I've been the provider for my wife and I for about 5 or 6. The problem has always been that it's dangerous and it keeps me out at all hours of the night. I work about 80 hours per week on average and I'm not compensated well at all. It's been hard on our family but I've kept going for selfish reasons and because I'm never going to find something that pays as well even though it's not much. My wife has been taking online classes for about five years now and she'll be done next month. Has a new job lined up and everything. She'll make well over double what I make so the time has come for me to leave my career. 
  I'm sorry to sound so melodramatic but I feel like this is the end of my life. Really. I identify myself by my job and my family role. I'm the guy that provides. I'm a smart man, I have a degree, I'm using my degree in my field. I'll have to stop all of that. The skills don't transfer to any other field without re-training and I can't go back to school. The wife wants me to work a safe job that gets me home at a reasonable hour. She also wants to live in an area where there really is no work because that's where her family is. So I'm basically left with working in a warehouse driving a forklift. That's all I've got there.  That's all I can do. It's such a change. I have no purpose anymore. I'm not making money doing that. She's taking care of that. I'm not cooking and cleaning, she's made it very clear that she doesn't want me taking that over instead. I'm not contributing anymore at all. I'm just existing. Just leaving to do a job that means nothing so I can come back home and do more nothing. I can't take another job that has any kind of responsibility because responsibility means stress and long hours and that's two things she says she wants to change now. So I can't work toward anything. I've just got to be here. Why?
  I know that she loves me. I know that for a fact. I know that she will miss me when I'm gone. I have no other family. She didn't get along with them so we cut them out. It's just her and her family. I know for a fact that in five years, there's no possible way she is going to like the situation we are in. How could she? Go out to go work in a high stress job just to come home to your husband who's done ****all the whole day? There's no joy in that.
  I've got autism as well. I've never been able to emotionally connect. It's not something I'm physically capable of and she didn't realize it before we got married. That's horrible. She cries every day. And I can't help. I can't understand. I know she feels sad and I can't do anything about it. Saying there there only goes so far. She's going to realize sooner or later she doesn't need me. And where will I be then?
  Well I don't want to wait around and find out. I talked all that over with her and she just keeps saying she married me for me but you know eventually she's going to realize there's more to life than that. You have to like the person you're living with. I love her. I will do anything for her. Including getting out of the way. I'm ready to move on. I'm ready to let her take care of herself. I'm going to be holding her back and I don't want to do that. I know now that divorce isn't an option because she won't be able to move forward. She'll just keep trying to get me back. There's no finality to it. And I don't want to live without her anyway. What would be the point?
 So that's where I'm at. I'm thinking gun, hotel room bathroom, cover the room in plastic for an easy clean up, and call the police right before so no one has to discover me. 
  I haven't set a date yet. I want to wait until she starts her new job because I think she'll be beside herself too much to think about that and then they'll give it to someone else. The life insurance should take care of things for a little while and I plan to have a last will that specifies a pauper's grave so the insurance money goes as far as it can. 
  I already checked with the insurance company and they said suicide is no problem for them. They pay out all the time for that apparently. I'm outside of the two year term in which they wouldn't pay. So I'm good. She'll be taken care of and won't have me laying around taking up space. She can find somebody who treats her better. 
  If I'm not missing anything, I think I have a couple of months left tops."
Weissguard,5d023j,1479176452,Last call for help.,"Well, here goes nothing. This is basically me right now and maybe I just wanted someone to know because I want hope that someone can help.

* 21, in her 4th year of university. Still need 2 years to graduate. About to fail this semester because I didn't understand, couldn't study and let depression take over me
* Stopped seeing psychologist and psychiatrist because I didn't want help anymore. I just wanted to die. Also stopped medication which is depressing me even more. 
* Cry every night while shaking. Proceed to sleep for 15 hours at a time
* Dad left my family and since he was the money maker he rightfully took all the money and car away. Told me to kill myself and depression and all the reasons I take to a therapist is bullshit.
* Mom blames me for my dad leaving the family everyday. She never worked a day in her life and recently became a waitress with shit tips because her English is bad. 
* No friends. Only acquaintances that occasionally get together to study for class
* No extended family to help. Grandparents are in nursing home and cousins took over their control of the bank and their house. They hate us because they think we'll ask for money.
* Spent a year out of school as a NEET. Scared to shower or even go to the washroom at times. Came back to school only to find that I'm going to fail once more.
* No hope. No future. 
* Think about overdosing on medication everyday. Want to kill myself. 
* Steal food from stores because always hungry and don't have enough money to buy
* Guilty, humiliated and upset at myself for being a thief, failure undergraduate, cause of my broken family
* Trust and abandonment issues
* Daily routine is to sleep, look at Pokemon news, cry, call Suicide Hotline and hang up. 
* Sometimes will take 2 or 3 pills of medication when I'm supposed to take 1. Just to see what it'll feel like to die. Hopefully will get the courage to rid the Earth of cancer which is myself. "
tessallXll,5anxg4,1478059623,So Many Posts,"It breaks my heart. I come here with my own enormous grief, and to see how many posts are made in such a short time.. how can anyone possibly... I mean... Just there's so much need, there can't possibly be enough support to go around. 

But here I am, gonna give it a shot, because im hanging on by the skin of my teeth. Let me give you a frame of reference for my state of mind. I have spent every second for hours and hours of every day for the last 2 months looking for a reason not to kill myself. The weight of those reasons which I've found and people offer me seem to fade away. It's taking more and more energy. My thoughts are clawing into the depths of my understanding, I'm reaching everywhere... Other ppl, online, nature, exercise, distractions, philosophy, pschology... For a reason to want to be alive right now. It takes so much energy. My body is physically shaking, my hands are trembling, I can't seem to catch a steady breathfrom exertion of mentally trying to find a reason not to kill myself... and this goes on for hours. Until I come to some sort of vague, temporary conclusion, and then I burst into tears not only because of the overwhelming sadness but because of how much energy it took to get there. And then I do it all over again because they don't stick.

Please. Give me a reason to live.

Here's what I have heard and here's my responses so far:

1. I'm not alone. Well, no. But I don't have the companionship I need.

2.  You don't need it, you just want it. We all need more than bare bones survival in this world. I know what I find meaningful in life. When I had it, I was completely at peace and satisfied with life in a way I never had been befor. I had what I'd always been looking for. So screw the ""you don't need it"". I need it. I know what is meaningful to me in life.

3. When one door closes another door opens. I'm tired... I'm tired of chasing down open doors. And it's painful. So I'm tired and I'm in pain. I feel like a rat in a maze, and I'm just fucking done with this game. I don't care if there's better cheese on the other side of door a, b, c. I was happy with the cheese I had.

4. There's a plan for you. As I am tired of the maze of open doors, so too am I tired of fate or god or whoever and their bigger plans for me. Could not care less. Not interested in the greater meaning. Not interested in any meaning. I want my happiness back. Give it back. Give him back to me.

5. He was a jerk, just forget him, he's not worth your life. No, no he wasn't a jerk. He is a human being with his own baggage and I got caught in the swing of it.  But he is a good man and I'll not find one like that again. This was a relationship where I felt worthwhile for the first time in my life. My whole life I've been searching for something, never Satisfied. Until this relationship. In this relationship I woke up feeling worthwhile every day. I woke up satisfied every day ... Satisfied with my life, with myself. I wasn't seeking anything anymore, I had an inner peace. I wasn't seeking safety or love or validation everywhere I looked any more. It wasn't a perfect relationship by any means, and we had our squabbles  but I woke up consciously satisfied with life and feeling lucky every single day. And I've never had that kind of stability and feeling of satisfaction and peace and contentment in my life before.

6. You'll find other love. When? When I'm 40? 60? I am not interested in going 24 hours without it, let alone 24 days or 24 months or 24 years. And maybe I won't! It took so fucking much of my lifetime to set myself up for love, and I am not your standard attractive mate, nor do in lack discretion in my own choosing. I don't think I'm going to find someone who likes me and who  I like back for a long time if ever. And lastly, I don't care about other loves. I want him.

7. You need to love yourself. Ugghh, please, spare me. I do love myself. When I said I'm not your standard attractive mate, that doesn't mean I don't find myself attractive in non-standard ways. There's plenty I love about myself. I have plenty of talents. I enjoy plenty of hobbies. I believe I have good ethics and morals. I have family and friends although they're strangely distant now that I'm in all this pain. I love myself and have great things going for me. I know my life has value. That doesn't mean I want to live a solitary life.

8. Your family will be devastated. I know. And that breaks my heart. But why can't that understand that I'm just not happy being alive? Why can't ppl just accept suicide? Why can't you celebrate my relief from incessant sadness, pain instead of mourn my loss? Why can't they just be happy for me? I can't live for anyone else's happiness, I just can't. 

9. You have so much to offer the world. Look, I've given plenty to the world. I am a hard core volunteer and supporter of people in need. I made it my career. I have credentials in this. I know the value of community and helping others. My faith is in things like Dr. Who and star trek because of those core concepts. But I'm done giving. I hurt. I am in need. I lack love, safety, value, intimacy, physical touch, affection, and so on in my companionship. I am in need. At this point I'm asking why should my life be about what I can give to the world?

10. What about what you can take from it? I have spent my life working so hard through so much misery for one tiny iota of happiness. Everytime i get any, it gets cruelly taken away, over and over. If there are higher powers, they seem to be sending me a message. I don't think this universe wants me here.

11. It's not your fault. Well what if it is? What if I could have done something to fix our relationship but I wouldn't because I'm defective, unlovable, broken, unworthy? And what if it's not my fault? Then there's no hope for us in the future at all. I have to just accept the loss. And in won't. I WON'T. I want my love back.

12. Suicide will take away all hope. Ok, but I already believe that getting my lost relationship back might be hopeless. All I can do is accept. Well, I do not. I do not accept life without the happiness that I had. I do not want other happiness. I do not want to wait for it even if it is out there as I want it, which I do not believe it is. And frankly, there isn't always hope for everyone. So let's not go down that route.

13. You can get through this. I know I can. I don't want to.


There's more, but I'm tired. It may sound like I'm just argumentative and looking for reasons to die. That's not it at all. I argue because I'm looking for someone to argue back and give me the insight that I might be missing. I push because I'm looking for that push back. A real one. Not tricks to make me feel better, a real push, a real good reason.

Please, it anyone has an idea of a real, thoughtful, honest reason for me to live... Push me."
Ferfrendongles,5djd9g,1479428005,"It just gets worse and I just keep trying, but I find myself, emotionally and physically, ""giving up"".","I have crippling social anxiety, to the point that, recently, I've lost the ability to smile at others, emote in really any way, or connect with others in conversation (because the fear blots out any chance of my personality showing), and my voice has audible fear in it. I've somehow just worked my way into management in the job that I've been in for the last year, and now I make a decent salary, but my job is still largely customer service/leading a team, and I feel like I'm worsening so quickly that it's only a matter of time before I'm fired. I'm a nice person (by design, not nature), try to be helpful all the time, and was pretty good at my old job (before promotion). I act nice and be helpful in lieu of being able to express myself, and I think that that makes it to where, even though I make every situation worse, I don't think anybody even talks bad about me behind me back, but I make everyone feel so weird that they always take deep breaths like they're starting to feel a small empathetic taste of what I feel all the time, and their chest tightens, and they're like ""this is really awkward"", but it's not ""awkward"", it's like they're scared, too, but no one is afraid of me.. I don't know how to explain it: I make people feel weird with how incredibly nervous I am. For instance, today, I went to visit my dad in hospice, and my grandma went too. Even she would find herself wanting to look away for some reason. 

I've always told myself ""no matter how much it hurts, you will always talk to anyone at work that needs to be talked to in order to make the place run better"", but recently, I've been so overly taut that I've just given up and stopped thinking about it all, because if I do, then it will cause me such shame and pain that I will physically recoil over and over just from the war inside of me, as if I'm being hit or something, all of which is played out by reliving old memories where I've made people feel bad or said something really really stupid.

The reason I've forced myself to endure all this crazy emotional turmoil that happens when I interact with people socially at work (rather than just being homeless, which is at this point I actively fantasize about), and why I've done it for a job, is because my wife left me a year ago, and we have a daughter that I haven't met yet, 7 months old. I need to be a good dad; I have to. I worked the industry that I'm in in the past, and was good at it, so I chose it in order to make the quickest possible transition from ""deadbeat"" to ""dad material in the eyes of a court"".


As far as the origins of all of this, I have only myself to blame. I was an addict from 2009-2013, and barely recovered this last year, cognitively and emotionally I mean. I'm still fucked, but I was much, much worse. I lost all of my memories of childhood and most of everything else in the process of addiction. I don't even know how to put into words what that does to you, because I can't know what it's like to have a real living memory anymore. I feel as though I'm completely unanchored and alienated from everyone. It was synthetic cannibinoids and assorted ""research chemicals"", if you're interested. All of that, and the things that I did on drugs, combined with the fact that I was really something to behold before it all (you've probably heard something I've written played on the radio), has left me utterly ashamed, I think, to where I can't accept myself, much less expect anyone else to. There's so much more that I can't even reasonably expect anyone to care to read.. 

 I didn't/don't want to be a bad dad, and so even though I'm torn apart by fear and loathing and loneliness, I still keep waking up each day, crying as soon as I realize that I'm about to start another day, and going to work.

 So about my daughter: My wife just left town one day a little while after she left me, moved out of our apartment, and moved in with her friend. Her friend didn't know where she was. I found her by hiring a P.I., because you can actually do that. My wife can prove that I was an addict but I can't prove that she was, and I lived so shitty for so long that there would be no chance a judge would think of seeing me as a potential father, only a potential pay check (Texas: it likes to imagine it's very chivalrous, and the easiest way to do that is to side with women by default). Knowing I had no shot, not being able to find my wife, being utterly alone, I decided I'd become what I needed to become, and then I actually went out and did it, for the first time since addiction.

  I have worked my way up into salary; bought a house and rebuilt it from the plumbing to the subflooring to the electrical, all without any prior experience; got sober (just weed this time); paid off old debts; have a pile of gifts for my daughter for when she arrives, from myself and a lot of excited sibs, aunts, uncles, grandmas and a grandpa; and got myself looking good again.


I am deathly afraid of failure in social situations because if I continue to worsen, then I will lose one of my biggest ""selling points"" (my job) in my eventual custody hearing. Even if I keep my job, go to court, don't win primary custody, and I lose my job afterwards, then I will still be required to pay the rate of child support that was set when I was making salary (Texas), because I'm ""capable of providing"" at that level, or some bullshit like that. I know I do not have it in me to do this again. Something would give before I made it this far. If I'm right, and I can't recreate this in the event that I lose it, then I won't be able to make child support payments, and then I'll be subject to any number of nasty penalties, jail time being chief in my mind, and the back child support just accrues. At that point, with my life the way that it is, I don't think I would have the will to keep living. I say that both sincerely and for the sake of argument.


I know you're going to think that I'm overthinking the custody thing, or that the courts couldn't possibly be as biased as I make them out to be, or that it can't be *that* bad when I talk to people, but I'd be willing to skype with someone and upload the talk, so that you can see what I mean. I don't think I've ever met anyone as bad as I am. I make people look away if I look at them; I cause people to feel pain with my presence. 

I want to run, and I have nowhere left to go but down.. "

Eqofriendly,5eefja,1479862404,She left. I'm lost.,"Since my girl of 2 years left the other day with all my money I don't know what to do...

We met 3 years ago, and hit it off immediately, bear in mind I was 18 as was she, I'm mature for my age because of what I've been through my whole life, what I've done and what I've dealt with... We were perfectly happy together at the start, in fact I don't think I've felt that good since my dad died. I'd been out of a relationship for 3 months and she was the prettiest thing I'd ever seen, and she liked ME... I'm not used to it, I have pretty shitty self esteem, she didn't judge me, just showed adoration and happiness, it made my worthless life something, before her I was nothing. 

Eventually I found out about her demons, her family who treat her like a slave and bullied her her whole life, her dad walked out, her mum beat her, her sister abused her and her only friend was her other sister. She moved in with me shortly after it kicked off again... 

Her family never liked me, attempted to get me arrested a few times, attempted to hurt me a few times...

Eventually me and her started argueing as all couples do, because of her lies, and hiding stuff; such as meeting guys behind my back, clubbing, getting drunk with ex's etc... even went so far as to one time hit her, I didn't want to but I couldn't stop myself, not anywhere dangerous, just the leg. But I felt terrible... Cried myself to sleep for weeks. 

Because of this I started doing it more, as it scared me, and when I'm scared and losing control of a situation I lash out due to fear. Eventually I decided I'd try and help myself, however it was too late, she walked out on me, I told her we'd sit and talk and fix things, but she hadn't felt the same since she moved in, even though we were fine then... 

Me and this girl had a life, we were engaged, looking at houses, driving, both had jobs, we were doing so well for ourselves considering we were 20 and 19... SO well =/ Then it all went tits up because she decided to leave, and her sister who had threatened me, had me nearly lynched, called cops on me multiple times was going to come get her... I flipped out, grabbed my knife because of the guy she was bringing with her, terrified, so I sort of sat in fear of my life as he was meant to lynch me, in the kitchen, she stormed past me, I grabbed her and one thing led to another, and she thought I was threatening her...

Due to the confusion and heat of the moment I forgot the knife. I scared the love of my life off. Even though it was salvageable to that point.

I'm lost, I need help. Because the night she left I tried to kill myself with a gun. However the weapon jammed, and the moment passed, I'm afraid it's going to happen again. I am so terrified of everything right now, I just need help. Work is stressing me out, these drugs are helping a little but not much, I have a 2 week wait for councilling and I'm not sure I'll make it that far, what should I do? I want her back, I miss her... It kills me thinking that some other guys hands are where mine belonged, someone else is kissing her where I did. Someone has probably replaced me, and it is terrifying... Honestly terrifying, I feel like while she's off having fun, (she said she was upset; so I took her a cuddly toy, flowers, chocolates, a get well soon card, sleeping pills and an advent calander, paid for her train to another city to see her sister for a while, and even went as far as to block her on everything so she can heal, but I'm not healing, I want her to know how I feel. I don't know where to go from here...).  

I've tried everything. I just want to die now. To rest and not worry about everything, I just need some advice, what would everyone else do in my situation? 

She said she wants to be friends, but that never works, and everyone knows it, it'd kill me seeing her with someone else... It kills me even hearing her name or seeing her face =/ She said she loves me still and misses me, but I want her back, more than anything... I'm scared in case it all gets worse. I want her to be happy, but I want to be the reason she's happy... Someone PLEASE help me =/ I'm lost and worthless without my gal. =/ She made my life what it was, helped me so much and made life worth living...

I did everything for her. I helped her reconnect with her dad after 15 years, I helped her get out of the domesticly violent situation, I helped her love herself again, and in doing so forgot about myself. I don't know what is happening to me. I don't know why I can't just get over it. I know shit happens, but this is killing me inside.

LoserLoosington,5c50my,1478739947,I'm the biggest loser of all time. AMA,"You know when people on reddit say they used to be grade-A students but now are merely mediocre? I'm neither of that. All my life I was an extremely lazy, underarchieving piece of shit. I remember when I my first homework in kindergarten I cried and just refused to do it. I hated kindergarten so much, I had no friends and I just wanted to go home and watch TV or play games.

10 years later and I'm still the same. No friends, hate school, bad grades and I'm still in front of a screen all day. I just got a D- today in maths, like always. I actually try to be mature and do something for school nowadays, but I have zero motivation. Whenever I try to learn something I just get a headache and afterwards I'm like ""Fuck this, I will fail anyway"" and then I'm watching TV again. I know this is bad but I can't help it.

My mom is probably extremely disappointed in me, and I don't blame her. She is extremely stressed out because I always get in trouble because of my grades, I'm often too late to class and  always forget homework and school stuff. I feel like such an asshole.

I literally have no skills or hobbies, I just don't know how I will ever function in the real world. I even would be ok with working a shitty McDonalds job but I live in rural Germany and there are only manual labor jobs. I'm way too clumsy for jobs like these. In Germany grades are extremely important so I'm basically screwed. I just have good grades in English, geography and history but that's not going to get me a job. In everything else I have D's and F's.

Nowadays I just live in apathy. I lost all my emotions and the only thing that comforts me is death. I just want to end my shitty life. I don't contribute anything to society anyway, I'm a lazy slacker and it would actually be better if I just wouldn't exist. I tried to stop being such a pussy and get my shit together, but I always fail. I know this is all pathetic.

I'm not trying to start a pity party, I just really need some advice about my life. I have no idea how to stop being such a lazy fuck."

iSeize,5ccl4p,1478838240,My college buddy is battling crippling depression and suicidal thoughts. He's just started therapy today. I need to know what i can do to help,"Hello friends, Canadian here. story time. My buddy is 32, im 26, and we both graduated together. He's from out of town but landed a job in my city after grad. He bought a house with his fiancee and they both started to settle in. But his boss was toxic. A sour woman, never compassionate or a real leader. Ive heard nightmares about her from other people in our industry. She wrote him this fairytale that he'd be signed up for an apprenticeship within a year, all this stuff. but it never transpired, and it started to get to him, which is bullshit because he's a VERY hard working, smart guy, just dyslexic and doubts himself on some things. Anyway i pretty much think all this is her fault.

Hes 32, no pension yet, and still making only a few bucks over minimum wage. I imagine that would kinda get to you and make you feel like a POS after 10 or more years of being in and out of school and the workforce. He started to get bummed out about work and eventually had to take time off and admitted to me he was depressed. I think he did the right thing by selling his house and moving back home, he even got a new job at a much bigger and better company, then got married and got a great new home. I'm really happy for the guy. I'd kill to have what he has in his life.

We dont speak so much anymore but i thought the new company would be good for him. But it turns out hes fallen back into depression and its even worse now. He been at the new job about 2 years and they are now being reluctant to train him in more fields of work even though hes completely gung-ho on learning them. Their continued rejection (over 4 months) led him to a mental breakdown, stress related insomnia, and basically crippling depression. hardly any sleep or food. he asked doctors for help many times and was given sleeping pills. (i was so pissed when i heard that).

He's been off work on medical leave since October and is starting to come back but he thinks the progress is painfully slow. Only after admitting to a doctor that he's been having suicidal thoughts every day did they agree to send him to therapy (any therapy before this point would have been out of pocket)
He just had his first therapy session today so i sent him a heartfelt text this morning to put him in good spirits and let him know i still got his back.

He says he's still in pain but the worst is behind him. And i had no idea.

so guys, i'm just trying to help the guy, because he deserves better than this. I just feel helpless because i've never been in his shoes. Im a happy-go-lucky person thats only really had one anxiety attack in my life. He's having them every day. I found out its hereditary. His mom is or was the same way. He finally understands that he cant get through this on his own and welcomes all the support he can get. He's off to a cottage this weekend but i hope to make it up to his place in the next while just to hang out with him. I really need advice. I know nothing about depression other than the looming sense of failure and anxiety that poisons your thoughts.

I appreciate any responses on the matter. thanks.

I should add that i dont beleive he's having these thoughts every day anymore but im sure they still persist. i dont want to say the wrong thing. Apparantly ive already said the wrong thing by noting to him that suicide is a selfish thing to do.
"
NoPhapping,5erlzx,1480046116,"WHAT DO I DO? If I stop being friends with this person, they'll probably commit suicide!","So I know a guy who has been spiraling into a seriously deep pit of mental illness.

When I first met him we both had a lot of stuff in common-- we were both very into technology, we both had very similar interests and viewpoints on life, etc. And best of all, (and worst) we both identified with each other very well in that we both struggled with depression and anxiety. We used to find comfort in discussing each other's experiences with life.

It soon became apparent though that he was the type that didn't want to work for anything. He always wanted the quick solution. He would always talk about short-term solutions like opiates, benzos, and a plethora of other drugs.

Meanwhile, I focused on things I felt would work better in the long term. I would talk about things such as cognitive behavioural therapy, the possibility of seeing a psychiatrist, going to a therapist, seeing a counselor, researching possible future cures, etc. But he didn't want to hear any of that. He would always say that he didn't think any of that would ever help him, and that ""his parents wouldn't think it was a good idea"" and any other excuse he could come up with. He was certain he was just too far gone for anything to ever help him. When in reality he has never tried anything.

I understand that depression and anxiety SUCKS because I felt it myself for 4 years. But... He didn't even want to try to fix anything.

Meanwhile, my entire life turned a complete 180. My depression is cured, my anxiety is almost entirely gone, and things are looking brighter than ever.

He contacted me the other night, after almost 2 months of very little contact. I just kind of grew apart from him as he didn't seem to want to do anything to fix himself. I understand he's going through pain, I just... Can't bring myself down watching him. I hope this doesn't make me seem selfish.

That leads us to now. He has been using IV heroin now. He literally just picked it up randomly. He didn't start with any other opiates. He just went straight to IV heroin.

*Sigh*. He literally doesn't seem to care where his life is headed now. He has track marks all over his arms, told me he tried meth last week, and basically let his parents find the weed he so recently started using just because. He said he wanted them to find it. It almost seems as though he thrives on conflict. His grades in college are plummeting as well: his average grade is now a C- whereas a while back he was doing well with A's.

Additionally, he has been consuming a somewhat concerning amount of benzos. Forgot to mention that. He told me that he mixes it with Phenibut, and together they make it so that he could ""literally stab his entire family and everyone he knows"" (direct quote) and he would literally not care. He said he took 8 lorazepam tabs the other day in class and was just staring at his phone for no reason and the teacher got onto him. He barely remembers anything anymore.

He told me he almost sent a message to all of his contacts that he was going to jump off the tallest building at the university he attends.

This has all happened in just 2 months.

He said that he has no friends and that all of his past friends have grown apart from him and ""ditched him"". He has become very egotistical lately and reckless, so I can definitely understand why a lot of them don't want to be friends with him anymore. He doesn't care if he just straight up confronts people on something he didn't like that they did anymore.

He said that if he doesn't have any friends he will just kill himself.

He said that the last time someone shot him up, he told them to put in an amount that would make him overdose. They declined, of course. But he said he would have been fine if they had.

I feel like he's going to keep going down until he hits rock bottom. Or worse.

I just... I don't know what to do. He doesn't want to fix anything. I'm worried these benzos are taking away his fear of death so much that he'll actually end up doing it.

I'm so torn. I'll probably feel like it's my fault if he kills himself, but at the same time I can't spend every other day with him as he always wants me to. Uggh, I feel like such a terrible person. I feel like part of him is crying out for help, but I don't know how to communicate to that part.

I have lurked this sub in the past when i was a bit depressed and many of the comments helped me tremendously, but I am now past that stage and I have a friend (we are both in high school) who I recently befriended this school year (my friend is a bit shy, and doesn't really talk).

We have started to talk a lot recently and I learned about my friend's current situation which is a bit tragic (which for privacy sake, I will not state), and even if I talk  about my experiences and what helped me, our causes of depression are completely different.

I'v been so clouded by my depression that I couldn't see the good... nay, GREAT things in my life, and have pissed them all away.

As soon as it went away, two other problems I've had in the past at separate times and never major, have both hit at once. Plantar fasciitis and matatarsalgia. Sounds serious, but they are just aggravations and a doctor can fix it. I don't qualify for medicaid and the free clinics require paystubs and a local license. Neither of which I have. My foot is now swollen and I can't walk on it. This is ridiculous. I have to do what's right for my family. I'm bankrupting my retired father who has very little money left. My death will be a financial windfall for them. Dad will get 750/mo for the rest of his life from my SS which has about 150,000 in it. My sister will get a lump-sum tax-free check of 68,000 dollars from my pension. If I had access to either of these, I'd be fine. But I don't. I hate, hate, hate to have to die. But this isn't fun anymore. The mental pain of years without work is bad enough. Now I'm unable to even work at Walmart because I'm physically disabled. The foot is swelling and Lord knows what the hell is going on in my body that's causing it. But I'll never know because I have no access to medical help. I mean I could go to a doctor, but it would mean my dad would lose the house, and I'm not willing to allow that to happen. I'm so fucking done. I have only one problem-money. Not a single other problem. I'm immensely talented. I've been awarded the highest honor for my work in Hollywood. I have a million dollar talent but nobody will pay me a dime for it. My blood pressure is averaging 175 over 110 and there's not a damn thing I can do about it. I must kill myself. Sooner rather than later. I'm only posting here as my name says, I'm looking for answers. Really, my only problem is money, and I'll never see it. If the pain continues for a few more days, I'll be doing it by the end of next week. My youngest niece's birthday is in three days. I'll definitely wait. I will reveal my identity shortly before I do it. It's tragic. I don't want to die. I have so much more life in me, but life has consistently beat the fuck out of me and as well as I've handled it up to now, I just can't go on anymore. My family needs the money. I need the money but the only way I can access it is to end my life.  

What a shitty and completely fucked-up end to what was, up to a few years ago, an amazing life."
ErronBlack223,5egd3m,1479891484,New plan,I have set myself a new deadline. I will try to improve (even though i dont think it will work) and if i fail in 1 or more subject in school i will kill myself by the end of the summer next year. ive had enough of trying and failing.
sc0pe_,5en6vw,1479984199,Way to go world this is why i wanna die,The only thing more depressing than wanting to commit suicide is going to a site called suicide forum forum looking at 10 ways to die and not getting a single way to die. For fuck sake I'm on the suicide forum not the suicide prevention forum you false advertising fuckers. This is why I wanna die.https://www.suicideforum.com/2016/02/15/suicide-methods-10-ways-to-die/#
NatureJoseph619,5b58v7,1478283733,I've become obsessed with watching people die since I tried to kill myself,"On 4/06/16 I came the closest to ending my life thus far. In the weeks leading up to it I found myself online compulsively watching videos of people dying, just so I could see what I would look like to the people that found me.

It helped me realize that taking my life is likely the most selfish thing that I could do. My family aside, it is a slap to the face to whatever is the reason why i am on this earth. So I keep myself from going any further that day.

However, I still suffer from depression and after my girlfriend broke up with me a few weeks after she said she wanted to marry me, I feel like the person I cared about the most was lying to me the entire time. Like the only love that I felt was meaningful wasn't real and that I cannot be loved. I think about those videos every single day, every time that I feel like cutting or ending it, I watch those videos. I don't really know if they help anymore because I still have suicidal thoughts almost every day.

Does anyone else do anything like this?"
throwawitjdsoj,5c04nq,1478684027,I think I should start here...,"I initially thought I should try to help people here but seeing that I have been actively thinking about killing myself more and more for the past several weeks, I reckon my advice might be counter-productive. Seeing that I will probably be spending another night wide-awake (for no particular reason), I figure it would be worth trying to organize my thoughts here. 

About a couple of years ago I posted something on facebook. The next morning two pigs removed me from my house without a warrant, apparently if it's a ""medical emergency"", that is something that can happen.  I spent the rest of the day in the hospital and was back in school the next day. A couple of months later I tried to kill myself via an overdose. 

I have been diagnosed with depression and am making what efforts I can to engage with it. I have been off the medication for the last 2 years. I was prescribed Haldol and see no reason to destroy my brain more than necessary.  I am extremely ""basic"", but I assume that many people who think about killing themselves feel that way. Whenever I am exceedingly anxious and/or hungry I start hearing mutterings (throat clearings, brief coughs; sounds that are typically used to inhibit conversation or que a specific behavior from someone else). I understand that Haldol would attenuate these sensations.

I have wasted a mind-numbing amount of my life. Porn, video-games, television, school. ""Doing the best I can"" is incredibly disappointing (academically, professionally, socially, intellectually, etc) and makes suicide all the more fascinating. The more I think about my situation, the angrier I get at my parents and the rest of my family/the state. All of the issues I am dealing with are reversible. They developed as a result of the harrowing incompetence of my parents. They would resolve themselves in a reasonable amount of time if I were able to consume the medicine and food I want in the appropriate quantity. I have been trying to ""get on my feet"" for the past several years. Thinking of spending the rest of my life alone and in service to rich people to be a profound waste. Ideally I would  go to sleep and never wake up. I am sure many people feel similarly. 

I believe that I am suffering the effects of severe psychological trauma. When I was younger, I rode in a commercial van on a plastic tote without a seat belt many times. There were only two seats and my older sibling sat in the other one. The immediate reactions of all of the medical professions that I have talked with about the experience lead me to believe that it is a relevant experience and would have a profound impact on the rest of my life. My parents were surprised to here that it may have been a possible cause of my present predicament. I was also bullied regularly in elementary school. I have never been homeless but my family did threaten to kick me out.

I cannot control my own thinking. I am aware that this is typical but the fact that everyone have a roughly equivalent experience does not help me. My ruminations tend to settle on killing myself. I played soccer during my younger years and had a couple of fits of banging my head against a wall during more acute episodes. From what I have gathered brain trauma  increases the possibility of dementia at a later age. 

All of the behaviors that cause my consternation are permanent. They are never going away.  Seeking marginal improvements (while being exposed to toxins, radiation, apathetic assholes, etc ) everyday does not seem fulfilling.

I am learning that the desire to harm/kill myself stems from a general inability to cope with my experiences/emotions. Again, this could have been prevented if  society was organized in a rational manner.  

Finally, I am aware that suicide is a drastic, permanent behavior. That makes it all the more tempting. 

I never asked for any of this.

throwaway40204,5d95r5,1479302769,I have woken up suicidal every day this past week. I'm getting tired of it.,"My soulmate and fiancée died over two months ago and now my life is split in two: before and after her death. Shock set in immediately and started disappearing after the 1.5 mark (though it is not completely gone). Shock is good.

I'm tired of living in this reality. Her death was the trifecta of trauma since she was young, it was sudden, and it was an accidental suicide that she did not want and could have genuinely been prevented. I left her to go out of state earlier that day and by the time I landed, I was told she didn't make it. I got all her messages for help once I reconnected to the network. All in one lump.

They took all the guns out of the house over time, reassuring me that it is as safe as it could be in this new state. There is a bullet hole in our bookcase. Her gun is in our closet, lodged in a boot and hidden from sight. My secret escape is a .22 cal rifle; it makes me more nervous that it might not kill me than the fact that I sleep next to it.

I must find her, wherever she went. I must go to her. I don't want to hurt other people but this thought does not leave. I can't talk to others because I know they're tired of hearing the same thing. I don't want to be here anymore. Everything is dripping in black and all the other widows are right - this type of suffering does not go away and due to the nature of her death, I don't even want to bother trying to survive anymore. 

I just need to buy the right bullets.

I have had non stop anxiety and panic attacks for weeks. I  ant keep feeling like this and nothing I try to do for myself makes me feel better I just feel useless or guilty. I can't eat, I can't sleep, I don't know what to do I just don't want to feel the pain anymore. Help me"
somebodystopme12345,5edwhw,1479856276,Why?,"Everywhere I go, I see people who are just trying to get by. There's nobody in the world that's really flourishing. I've been trying to achieve a dream of mine for years now, and nothing has come of it. I don't know what to do anymore. It doesn't seem worth it. It seems like I'm doomed for the type of mediocrity that I can't stand... that type of life where everything's just barely OK... where you're holding everything together just barely, and the whole house of cards can come tumbling down at any moment.... that's what my life has felt like up to this point. It's either suicidal depression or, when I try, just barely keeping it together.

Is that worth it?

Are there really people in this world who are happy?

Is happiness even possible?

I don't mean like, a fun afternoon or weekend, but I mean a life in which you truly feel fulfilled and you truly get what you want. I'm not asking for a life free of suffering. I know that's impossible. I just want a life where I can fucken breathe. Where it's not just one day bleeding into the next because I have to work my ass off just to keep things together.

Yesterday a person who I thought was the most reliable and trustworthy person in my life fucked me over.

There's no more reason for me to live. Everything seems pointless. It's fucken bullshit.

What's  your reason to live? Your family? Your friends? Even they can turn on you.

I'll be leaving behind quite a few people... but fuck it... I have no reason to stay."
Captain-Nemo,5ak4nr,1478018484,I'm not sure how to get through this.,"Everything about my life just seems so wrong. Like my life is a soap opera at this point. I've been fighting against mental illness for nearly my entire life, and it's a battle I'm coming close to losing. 

I was born the wrong person, and though I'm closer to being her now than I have ever been, it feels like every time I move in the right direction more thing pop up to push me back.

My initially amicable breakup has turned anything but, despite my best efforts. I can't work because I'm so anxious I'm on the verge of a breakdown every time I'm in a classroom. My work on a college degree has been stymied at every step by my own inaction, my depression, or through family intervention. I don't want to die, but I don't see another way out of this mess at this point. It just feels inevitable.

I do still have nice days; days I feel pretty, days my anxiety quiets, and days that I can spend with friends. Unfortunately my two best friends are across an ocean from me now. One in England for study abroad, and one in Djibouti for a military deployment. Between that and the breakup my entire local support network uprooted itself from my life.

I have other friends too, though they are to busy with college to be the kind of support I need right now. I'm in therapy, and it does help some days, and others it just reminds me of everything wrong with me. Dating is also almost impossible for me, as no one wants to be with a half-finished girl.

So what is there for me to do? I can't work, I can't study, I can't socialize, there is nothing to do but wait. Sadly the waiting is what's killing me. The same medication that is making me into the girl I've always wanted to be, also seems like a way out of all this right now. 

The fact that I'm even considering this scares the hell out of me. I've survived suicide attempts before, and every time I do, I'm always glad I did. But even knowing that, I can't seem to curb these feelings.

It's so hard for me to open up to my friends and family about this stuff. I don't want them to think something is wrong with me. I don't want them to pity me. I don't want to feel like they are my friends only because they feel bad. But without opening up there isn't anyone I can talk to about this except Reddit. Don't get me wrong, you guys and girls are amazing and you've helped me through a lot of stuff in the past, but it's not the same as talking about it with someone I know.

I don't even know what this post is. Is it a cry for help, is it just me venting? I don't think this is goodbye, I just don't even know where to begin to piece myself back together. Sorry if this seemed a little rant-ish. I hope you all are having a better day &lt;3"
ElypseSakuraSyberium,5axvwf,1478192244,make it go away,"junior in high school, was abused by multiple people during my short life, have depression, anxiety, ptsd, adhd, monophobia, and more, i self harm too much and have attempted 3 times just this year, and i think that its time"
meidocafe,5fela0,1480370490,My friend [M 50+] has been attempting to kill himself,"This is my first time posting on reddit with such a serious issue so I apologize if this isn't the right place to look for advice. 

My friend [M age 50+] went through with an affair with someone I knew closely. She had treated him like a sugar daddy but in a very smart, manipulative way so it looked like (to him) that she was truly in love with him. They are both married to different people.  She was just bored and looking for attention. After a year of this weird sugar daddy treatment torment(but him still falling deeper in love with her), she decided to become cold and manipulatively try to act in way that would get him to break up with her. But he felt like he was too old and too deep in the relationship to give up on her and went through so much emotional abuse. He had devoted his life to her, his finances, his time, his mental health. He was even ready to give up on his current marriage. It was so dumb to me. Now that she completely cut ties, he has attempted to kill himself twice. I'm the only person who knows about his problems. He's cutting all his life lines even with my pleas not to do so. I'm just a 20-some year old kid with anxiety who's trying to graduate from college. Before this, he was basically my godfather.
We had put points together and found out she had almost all the signs of NPD and NPD help says that the best way to deal with someone who has NPD is absolutely no contact. He intellectually knows she's not good for him but he says he's dead without her love. He's shattered. His only reason for living is clinging on to the hope that she'll return to him but ...that's not going to happen. He's been bargaining with me to help him get back together with her. I don't want to because it was so unhealthy. He knows it, he doesn't care. In his own words, he'd rather die used and completely wrung out with her love in his life (even if its fake! His words!!!)than live without her. It's honestly so fucked. He thinks about her every second of the day. I don't get it at all. 

She's [F 25] living her life happily with her own marriage. She was depressed bc the stress of the affair was weighing on her too. I suspect he was moving fast bc he was so old but he said she initiated everything that furthered the relationship into an affair. 

I just don't know what to do. I'm being asked to help get her back but I don't want to. I'm afraid telling him so will truly trigger his death. I know she won't go back to him. It's been 3 months since the affair breakup.
I know this is a text wall but I'm honestly so stressed right now. Any advice for my friend and any advice to stay sane while keeping my friendship with him?

TLDR
[M50]friend is going through heartbreak and he's attempted to kill himself twice. He doesn't want to accept a life without her love. I don't want to help him get back into that unhealthy relationship. I try to be there for him but it's been months and I'm a tired helpless college student. Every day is stressful for me, even more for him.

(extra info: He lives across the continent)

sry, thanks"
Happy-Happy-Joy-Joy,5c98sh,1478800639,I'm Just So Tired.,"I'm just so tired of the day to day grind of life. I wake up, go to work, come home try to enjoy one of my many hobbies yet can't due to my constant anhedonia, then go to bed. Rinse and repeat. I don't have a bad life, have a fairly stable support system if needed, and i have plenty of things to keep me busy yet i'm so tired of living. I wish i could just quit my job and live somewhere deep in the woods. Just be me, nature, and a small little cabin to live in. I'm so sick of people, there was a time when i was a very social person albeit with some social anxiety, however years of working retail made me loath human interaction. I now have crippling social anxiety, depression, and can't enjoy anything in life.
I've tried years of therapy, meds, and coping techniques to no avail. I feel like if i had even a touch of enjoyment from job i might  be able to cope, however finding a job I would like seems so out of reach. I have never had a single relationship, in high school i never really cared about dating and now that i've been out on my own for years my day to day grind leaves little availability to meet people. You need money to survive and you need a job to make money. I have no dreams, no goals, no future in sight, and i would love to just not exist. I feel it would be a lot easy than this current cycle i continue to put myself through. I don't believe in god so i'm pretty damn sure when it ends, just like that it ends, nothing beyond that and that doesn't bother me one bit. Tbh i can't think of any well intentioned yet shallow responses that will make me feel better but i figured i'd give it a shot and post here. Maybe someone can give me their perspective as mine is most likely skewed by years of depression. "
Throwaway180792,5ejbm2,1479930582,Friend is suicidal. Should I tell someone?,"I have a really good friend who is suicidal. As far as I know he doesn't have any concrete plans about when and how. But he tells me that it will happen sometime in the next few years at most. He is very determined, and I honestly believe he will go through with it if nothing happens. 

The problem is that we are internet friends, so to speak. I've never met him personally, and I don't know any of his friends or family. It's also really hard for me to talk to him, as I don't know what to say. This far I feel like I can't be very helpful, and that I'm saying the wrong things. I will read up here on how to improve this, how to talk to him, but I think it's very difficult when I can't see him in person (We live in different countries). 

He claims that the only people he has told about his suicidal thoughts are me and his therapist (who he recently started seeing, according to him). I feel like I can't be entirely sure that he has told everything to his therapist though. Should I reach out to the therapist (I know his name) and give all the information I know, so I can be sure my friend gets the right treatment? Should I try to contact one of his family members who might be in a better position to help him? Or should I just try to provide the best help I can myself, even though I feel like I'm not fit to help? I would love any advice on what to do, as this is a very difficult situation for me. "
onleeace,5ejhqi,1479932235,What's Wrong With Me? Why Do I Have To Suffer So Much?,"I don't know why I'm doing this here but since no one else really listens to me, why not give it a try?
I've been alive for 16 years now and to be honest, I would have never imagined life to be this horrible. It all started after the first semester in 9th grade two years ago when something inside of me suddenly started to crack. I'm still not sure (and no one's able to tell me) what caused all this to happen, but I have some hypotheses. So first of all, I should actually have no reason to be THIS sad and it makes me feel so guilty. My parents are divorced, but it's been like that for more than 10 years already and I think I wouldn't want to change that since I'm staying at my dad's place every weekend, my parents don't hate each other or anything, my stepfather isn't too bad and my little sister can be really nice to be around at times, too. I used to have a really awesome group of friends but we kind of drifted apart after most of them changed schools and also, I used to be one of the best students in class back then (maybe because my mom put and still puts a lot of pressure on me to only come home with excellent grades though). I was really extroverted, always laughed and made jokes, aced every test and barely had to study. Basically everyone wanted to be around me because I had such an uplifting aura and I really enjoyed hanging out with a large group of people and being in the centre of attention. But then everything changed for the worse so rapidly, I couldn't handle it. I was still doing fine at the beginning of 9th grade but I noticed how I increasingly lost motivation to do things and with that my grades went down the tubes.
My story isn't over yet, but I think I should tell you one of my hypotheses here because it might be the reason (a really stupid reason) why I became such an emotional wreck. I need to give you some background information though; so I've been into this Korean boy group for almost exactly three years now and I have to say that one of the members is probably the only reason why I haven't killed myself yet, even though he could have possibly triggered my depression. After my ""clique"" split up I felt really lonely and I needed something or someone who can give me some comfort and at that time I was already a pretty big fan of this group, but got more and more obsessed after time passed. It got out of control. My obsession with this goddamn man went so far that I started to skip school because I was so scared of missing out on something related to him, I had panic attacks and was extremely anxious when I wasn't able to check Twitter every second, my friends were terrified and stopped talking to me because I behaved so weirdly and on our school trip to Ireland I once burst out crying because I told myself over and over that I'm a horrible person for not keeping up with his daily life since I couldn't use my phone all the time. Of course there were so much more incidents but I won't bother you with all of them... let's just say it was an ""interesting"" experience. I'm sorry, you probably think I'm crazy, but maybe I really am and they should just let me perish in an asylum!
Sorry, I'm going to move on with my story. Now you know why I'm thinking that this could possibly be a reason for my dilemma even though I've never told anyone before because I'm too scared of people judging me. I guess this whole drama about my obsession drained me so much that I even lost my last bit of motivation to stay updated every day and since then it's been an up and down kind of thing. I'm still really dependent on this group/guy but it's not close to as bad as it used to be. Sadly back then I didn't know what else I had to do go through. You know, no one except my close friends knew about my obsession so it wasn't a big deal for me and I never thought about what impacts it could have on my life, so I just tried to erase it from my memories and it even worked for a while. But in 10th grade someone suddenly noticed that something's not right with me. I myself didn't notice how much I changed over summer break and the exact same thing happened this year again, but I just can't help it. So in 10th grade when I got my first 5 (worst mark in my country) on a the first math exam we had, my math teacher reached out to me and literally asked what's wrong with me these days since I've never failed one of her exams before. Of course I told her that everything's fine, but she didn't believe me at all and wanted to talk to me personally, so we arranged a meeting and she asked me some questions, I answered and I don't really know how to describe it, but I just loved to talk with her. She's one of the kindest and most understanding people I have ever met and I wish everyone could have someone like her in their life. When I'm around her I always get this sudden feeling of safety and comfort, it's so nice. Up until this day I still talk to her weekly (so this kind of ""relationship"" or bond, whatever you want to call it, has been going on for a very long time already) and I can't describe it in words how grateful I am that she realised how miserable I actually felt. She also talked to my mom several times about my problems and mental state, but since my mom doesn't really care about the way I feel, it was completely useless. She's still as ignorant as before when it comes to topics like this and I really hate her for that but you can't change someone's way of thinking this easily, so I just don't care anymore. I'm not even trying to explain things to her anymore because it will only end with me being yelled at or being kicked out of the house and feeling even worse than before our conversation. As you can probably tell, we don't have the best mother-daughter relationship, but I'm not complaining because if I was here, I would be overwhelmed with someone like me too. I mean, I actually am overwhelmed with myself... so yeah. I'm just glad I have my math teacher since I can tell her anything without feeling judged and we really do talk about everything and I'm actually convinced that I wouldn't be here anymore without her. One time I ran to her, looking like I've been crying for several days straight, the morning after my mom kicked me out and I told her that I wanted to die, and she didn't freak out or anything, she just tried to calm me down and let me see the aspects of life that she thought were worth living for.
This post is getting way too long to be honest, I'm really sorry for making you read so much (if you're still reading this sh*t) but I just feel the need to write all these things down. I'll try to summarise it a bit more now.
One thing that even made my mom realise that something's wrong with me is when I suddenly lost a significant amount of weight at the end of 10th grade which was this year. I looked like a skeleton fresh out of the grave with only 43kg but to be honest, I really liked the way I looked and I still do... I was forced to gain weight this summer though because everyone was scared I'm going to die (which was my goal in the first place). I still hate myself for gaining weight because if I kept starving myself, I would probably be dead by now. And now we have finally arrived at this part of my story, my current state.
My life is useless, it's not worth all this suffering day after day... I don't have an aim in life, I don't have any hobbies, I don't have any friends, I'm failing at school, I can't stand myself, I don't remember the last time I smiled or laughed and really meant it, I feel like an object, not like a human being. I'm failing at life! I'm the disgrace of our society! The only reason why I haven't killed myself yet is because I'm a fucking pussy! I'm still waiting for something terrible to happen that pushes me over the edge to get the remaining courage to finally be able to finish the job. I stay awake every goddamn night and make up scenarios in my head about killing myself and I know it's completely crazy, but I enjoy it. Knowing that I can end my life so easily calms me down in a sort of way. The truth is, I'm convinced that no one needs me. Most of the people around me ignore me already anyway, so why not grant them their wish? If there was a button that erases my entire existence from the memory of all the people who have ever gotten to know me, it would have been pressed by now. And it's unnecessary to tell me that it'll get better one day because I know that it won't. That's wishful thinking. I've been trying to get help for two years and I'm just getting worse and worse. Why should I keep suffering and enduring this constant, nearly unbearable emotional pain when I don't believe in having a future. I don't even believe that I'll make it until the end of 11th grade. I guess life just isn't for everyone. It wasn't my decision to be born in the first place. Saying I hate my life would be more than an understatement. Of course some people might be a bit sad if I I'm not here anymore but they'll get over it and keep on living their lives without me and in the end it'll be as if nothing has ever happened. What's so bad about not wanting to be a part of all this? We are humans, we're not immortal, we will all die sooner or later. So why not speed up the process for the sake of my ""sanity""? Life should be enjoyable but it's destroying me and I just can't bear it anymore. It's too much for me. I feel so empty but so much pain at the same time, it's unbelievable. I just can't keep living like this. It's so frustrating to wake up every morning and regret your entire existence. Sometimes you just have to accept the fact that there are people out there who don't think highly of this whole ""life is a gift"" drivel and you don't do them a favour by literally forcing them to stay alive. Some people, including me, are better off dead.

"
doijustdienow,5azmv4,1478209283,Don't know what's next,"I honestly don't know how to convey my feelings and my situation into one post. I honestly don't know why I've decided that posting on reddit is something to even bother with. I'm sure there's lots of stories that are pages and pages long and some with just a sentence and I really don't know which to do or where to begin, but I'll try.

I have had a good life. My parents are not wealthy, but fortunate. I am currently living with family friends who were kind enough to let me into their home while I study in a nursing program. I have a girlfriend who is loving and sweet and forgiving that I have been with for 6 years now with a 6 month break in between 3.5 years ago. Point is, I have what I regard as a good life.

From an early age I matured both physically and mentally faster than other kids my age and thus I suppose subconsciously it was always assumed that I would do well or succeed at academic based things because I was deemed ""smart"" or ""advanced"". This continued throughout school up to my senior year in highschool. I started to undo a little bit. I never studied, didn't do homework, never needed help, and never failed. My grades suffered slightly but not much. During the end of elementary, middle/highschool both my parents became alcoholics. For example, mom would be incapable of making dinner so I had to for my siblings and I. Or I'd have to intervene between my mom and sister. Or listen to my siblings (both younger) complain/cry about my dad. 

Ah fuck it. Honestly. It's not much of a story, I don't attribute my failure to my parents being alcoholics. I never learned how to ask for help and I have an extreme aversion to failure, to the point of not starting things because I am afraid of failing. I've been depressed since I was about 14, I'm 22 now. I am intelligent and expected to do well but am horrified if i do fail. Well I did fail. I don't know how to study or ask for help and I suffered for it. Today I missed my nursing exam by 1 point. Yes when the score popped up it was borderline comical... My heart sank but I smiled at the irony. I had studied, prayed, talked to other students, everything I could think of to help me through this test - and I missed it by one point. The unfortunate thing is, I failed a test earlier in the semester as well, by 2 points. Now according to the policy, I am going to be exited the program. Nothing is in place yet, but there isn't any reason for them to break protocol and allow me to stay. 

Now for the point of contingency... My family friends are letting me live in their house so that I can go to school. My grandparents helped fund my schooling (not all, I covered atleast half so far). My work has let me have time off often for school. My girlfriend wants to get married after she and I finished school (which we would have both finished next fall). I feel like everything in my life, everything good and supportive is riding on this program and my success in it. Was I a fantastic student? No, no of course not. But I tried. I tried and I still failed. Everything in my life was riding on this and I have no excuse for why I failed. I played video games too often? I didn't know how to study? I wasn't smart enough this time? It just wasn't my calling? None of it matters. I failed and I don't know what to do with myself. Even this post is neurotic and sporadic. I am very calm right now, but there's a gnawing in the back of my mind. You failed. You let her down. You let them down. You failed. You fail. It's the end.
I don't know how to face my friends, my family, my girlfriend, my classmates. I don't know where to go from here. It feels like I halted everyone's plans and wasted everyone's, including my, time and money. What do I do now? Do I just die now?"

[deleted],5an4p9,1478049595,Everyone I know hates me and I don't know how to handle it.,"	Everyone I know hates me, for 3 years I guess I was on an alcoholic rampage, I dropped out of school in the ninth grade (due to bullying) and tried a homeschooling program that I pretty much ignored, there was never support on my mother’s end on any encouragement to help myself.  I went to the local community college at 16 to try and salvage some type of education. During this time I was dealing with severe mental health issues, mostly anxiety and never finished; so I decided to become a recluse and purely stay in the house only to come out and get cigarettes and using a cab service to go to counseling …. It wasn’t until 24 that I was convinced to make a effort to actually live and it was first of many horrible choices that I made in my life.


	I would generally meet men online have sexual relationships but generally avoid any type of emotional contact with them, there was a period that I dated a guy who was very accepting on my hermit lifestyle, I planned on just existing until I couldn’t do so any longer.  At 24 I met a guy who was much older and very kind, we planned to meet and many days I would have a new excuse not to meet him and at one point he made it clear he wouldn’t stop coming until I agreed to come outside and try to live and better my life.

	Having been diagnosed with a long list of mental health conditions,  just going to the store was truly a terrible experience.  This man I met had a life where alcohol was almost central to it.  He was married to a woman and the relationship was complicated, but it was understood for a long time that he is a gay man so I was accepted as a person who could come by and hang out with them and it wasn’t an issue.  My social skills were almost an absolute zero.  I would sit at this table with my head looking down and just uncomfortably reply to any conversation that was directly pointed to me, and I would do it with as few words as possible. Soon I started to realize after some drinking that it was a “great way” to rid myself of my social anxiety and become at least a bit talkative.

 	Anyway this person would go out to the bars almost daily and insist I come along, there was never a point that I felt comfortable about just drink, he had two friends who would openly state that they felt they were looked at as “lesser” for hanging out with me, I started getting black out drunk almost nightly and I don’t know when or where my horrible comments started to appear, but I would constantly beg to know what happened, it was the greatest fear of my anxiety losing control.

	 I stopped going out for about a year and a half.  Over that time my terrible behavior has been brewing in the minds of those I have upset and have been bothered with my behavior.  Even on a few occasions in public
I’ve been called a pervert or a asshole.  I even had times where I’ve been home for months and someone would bring up something that absolutely didn’t happen, but I have lost so much credibility it wouldn’t even matter to try to challenge it.  I’ve had an issue where I almost started a fight with a person, and that is where all my problems started.  I deleted all social media because of constant death threats, and a few drunken arguments of my doing. I tried to just avoid the situation and disappear.  I ended up on what I thought to be a obscure dating app, and I received a bashing where a few things of my behaviors finally came out, including harassing and talking to women in a absolutely horrible way, claiming to not be gay and just enjoying the head; strange and ignorant comments about college not being a right and something about the second amendment--things that in my sober mind I never think of or even care about. Sexually, I never thought of a time where I would even think of a woman in a sexual way like ever.  I have an affinity to them in the sense that I would generally find a woman as a doctor, counselor because I felt a bit more comfortable sharing my life with someone who could understand me without sexual overtones.  My main preference for that kind of support was generally gay men.  I  had all kinds of vague minor harassment then to the point when I would mention it to my psychiatrist I came off as crazy; my current psychiatrist even at one point asked if I was hallucinating.  Finally, last night it all came out that it was a game of group harassment; many of the people who were harassing me I don’t even know, and for the first time I was faced with some of the things I  absolutely had no clue about.

	I thought finally accepting responsibility and explaining where I was coming from:  my childhood, my self esteem issues, even giving the information for them to find court records about my father to help collaborate the life story I tried to tell--it got no where, and I just received even more abuse.  I tried to explain I was truly sorry for my behavior and even tried to make sense of it myself, but it became obvious that their intent was purely to try to tear me down ever further. The gay community wont even acknowledge me, though they never really did before but now many feel totally justified in throwing as much abuse as possible at me.  I offer to go down to the police station and take responsibility for anything that was said I did. I ask what could I do in anyway to try to show that I genuinely didn’t mean the problems I caused?  I even still plan from now on to just stay to myself, but the abuse just wont stop. I don’t know what to do, all I feel is an amazing level of regret for ever getting in a situation where I did leave the house. I just wish that when I was getting out of control that someone would have actually just told me but that never happened.

	I know this post is too long.  I just need to say something and my mind is truly a wreck.  I just don’t know what to do anymore, I am more than willing to go into more detail, but I’m just so worn down… The worse part is none of these people are even willing to explain what is/was going on, so for many things I just don't know.

ragamuffin_77,5ctg7u,1479088075,Feel like suicide is an impulse,"I have been plagued with suicidal thoughts and ideation for some time now. I have a plan and it is well thought out and takes preparation.

However I feel scared that I will do something on an impulse and that would be bad. My plan hopefully keeps my loved ones from finding my body. The other day I was sure that if I had a gun I would have shot myself. Now I don't have a gun nor do I have any idea how to get one. But I have also done things like put a belt around my neck and pulled it.  I cut too and recently cut my wrist, not deep but the urges are there "

aerocom,5f97np,1480300714,i think im ready. tonights the night,"so let me explain, and i donnt particularly want advice on how to get out of this, as ive already tried enough.

life began for me in middle school, as i barely remember anything before. i remember some stuff about me being in a dance group and some shit but it doesnt really matter. all that mattered to me was that i was about eleven or so, i had no friends, my parents are fucked up people and that im going to end up being a product of my environment. i was an absolute nerd. i had playdates with my two best friends that fucked me over in high school. i had really nothing to my life of any value. 

so middle school sucked. my parents were going through a divorce and they mixed me in with all their batshit crazy ideas on how to parent (one of them involved sharing a house which made it the center of violence between them). i had my fair share of kidnappings and being told to shut my mouth for many occasions of your local shitty neighborhood mess of a family. my older brother, younger brother and younger sister were pretty much not there for everything that i experienced, and theyre completely oblivious to the fact that anything actually happened. typical for these eggheads.

so i have insane parents that kinda fucked up my life. i had shitty grades, almost got expelled for writing a death threat meant for my new stepdad, and i had no friends, except for this one kid, who ill name john. john was a very special type of person, the kind that you arent really friends with but at the same time you cant consider them dead to you. a bit more than aquaintances, as we shared our time together playing dota 2, which ended up ruining my life. we shared some weird ass ideas to shoot up a school or two, but let those childish ideas slip off our shoulder as we kept some strange distance between us. he was the only real friend i had had for a long time. i had some best friends and other people that seemed important to me, but there were only a few that i actually gave a shit about, ill name them sue and jack. sue was a year above me, and jack and i were in a band together in fifth grade (among the only things i remember) and we grew up together. but everyone else in my life was either abusive, ill informed of my disposition to existing, etc. so those were the only real people in my life.

then came high school. 

first year, i had this other friend that was in said band, his name was ethan. ethan was the type of kid who would gang up on someone just for approval. that being said, he grew on my nerves and i had to deal with a year of bullying from him. i guess i didnt really care that much. in this first year, it was a fresh-ish start. i joined a nerd club and did nerd things. i got into music because i wanted to impress people with wonderwall at the eighth grade trip or something. i kinda started my life that year, and it was shitty. i spent most of it dealing with my new stepdad and stepmother and the emotions that followed that. i lived with my mother, who was an insane power hungry motherfucker. i really dont like her. my stepdad was even worse. but they put me through a lot of shit to say the least, and kinda left me fucked up. i told them that i had been given a noose by ethan and she kinda passed it off as unimportant, not even engaged enough to contact ethans mother, but i digress. 

so first year ended, i went to a nerd camp, showed off some dance moves and made some friends. i still kinda talk to them but i havent really talked with anyone in a long while so yeah. that summer was alright. i lived a week at moms and a week at dads and it didnt bother me too much, with the occasional ""i dont want to live anymore because i hate all of you"" here and there. at the camp, i met this girl, jess. jess was your typical ""holy shit i never knew someone could be this beautiful"" mixed in with your average christian. i talked with her for a long while, tried to get her into me, but failed nonetheless. we didnt even live in the same state, so after sophomore year started, she broke stuff off with me and i never heard from her again (until next year, keep reading)

there was a girl, her name is gonna be jenny. jenny was the type of girl that you really shouldnt try to have a relationship with but you do anyway and it fucks you up when all you want is that feeling of being important to someone. kinda messed me up. i got so sexually and idealistically attatched that i thought she would be my one but she was kinda just a person to make out with whenever i felt alone. she was fine with that. then i talked to this other girl online, got attatched, got fucked up and broke things off when she met a real person to love her. they broke up later that year, which was kinda sad. then came Kiran.

I capitalize Kiran because she was a real fucker uper. me being the shitty ass kid that wanted to feel something in life all the while pretending like im the living being that is above all my peers and shit. Kiran was the person that made me realized how fucked up i was and how i really needed help. so she called my parents, told them theyre fucked up and that they need to get me help. i got a therapist right after, and cut things off with her. all the while im taking ap us history, which is one of the worst classes ive ever taken. it killed me to the point of resorting to cutting for relief. i dont know how people can manage anything like that class. 

so i got some entry level help, cool shit and all. didnt do much for me. kept with that therapist for a while. but on the inside, i could feel myself dying. it was spring of sophomore year when i really felt like everything in my life was coming to an end. then i met another girl, dated her, broke up. but then Dylan came along.

Dylan was a special type of fucked up. theyre the kind of person to go around saying theyre feminist all the while discriminating against other feminists. i met her when i was still dating the last girl, and this is where the story gets really wonky. i was dating this girl, very happy and very okay with everything, then i met Dylan. the day i met her, she convinced me that i lost all my love for the previous girl and that i loved her more than anything in the world. you could probably imagine this idea fucking someone up, and it did to the point where it made me fall for her eventually. then we dated. she messed me up so bad that i still havent recovered, and its been a year and a half since then. mind you that my depression is getting worse and im getting to a point where nothing in my life seems to matter and that im doing all this for nothing. 

then she raped me, emotionally abused me, and broke up with me. she then went on to fuck with me for about five months, leave me alone for one, then come back and fuck me up again. she convinced me that all my friends were shit, and i broke it all off with everyone. then she left and i didnt have anyone to turn to. that september was one of the first times i tried to commit suicide. guess what my parents did?

nothing. they told me to get over myself, that im being selfish. they pushed me to genuinely think that i was in the wrong for ever bringing them to try to help me. so i ended up really fucked up. 

so let's recap so far: **shitty middle school, shitty high school start, shitty parents, shitty friends and shitty relationships. what next?**

so this is junior year now. i decided to fuck everything and move to my dads, as well as come out as gay and gender netural/fluid. i decided to fuck all my friendships, go towards a life of music and art while talking to people to try and make myself feel a bit better, ultimately failing. i tried doing what everybody told me (mainly sue): ""help yourself"" so i did and it didnt do anything for me. i dated another girl and it didnt do anything for me, and im still sorry i ever thought doing that would fix me or whatever. she deserved better. 

with my entire life flipped, nothing changed. i was told that i had a sister that died early on in her life. i was told that i might have made up everything in my head, but i didnt believe it. i was diagnosed as bipolar and with massive depressive disorder, basically nothing new. life was already shit and i ddint enjoy anything. i was making music and talking to people to pretty much destroy my life but that didnt change anything. 

Dylan came ""back"" just to fuck with me more, and i had occasional conversations with Kiran that fucked me up more. i was pretty much a walking suicide waiting to happen. i still am. so last summer, i got ""help"" from meds and a hospitalization that didnt do anything. i was cutting more than ever, not eating at all, and pretty much screwing up everything else in my life. meds didnt do shit. hospital didnt do shit. i spent the whole summer in bed. 

so then this year started. i got hospitalized after my dad beat me up. didnt help. new meds, didnt help. nothings helping. i just really want to be done with this shit. i dont find anything enjoyable. i try to lie to myself and think that its not so bad, but when i go to bed, i realize that its another full day that i could have been fine without living. there hasnt been a day since my multiple attempts that i actually found worthy of living. theres some cool people and cool music out there but at the end of the day, i dont enjoy any of it and would rather die. im not afraid of ending my life, as i didnt really think id get far beyond where im at now. 

i just got stitches for my leg. i cut it pretty bad. the only thing that is keeping me going is just wanting to rewatch this anime. i dont have any motivation, any goals, anything that could be consiered worthy of my life or time outside of being dead. i dont really want anything other than just ending it all as soon as i can. i want this to be the last night i have to deal with this. i dont want to live my life. i died a very long time ago, and im just a corpse waiting to bleed out eventually, or starve to death or something. im just waiting. i just want it to end. i dont really find anything worthy. i just want it to end.

if i dont end my life tonight, then my life is going to be nothing but doing what others tell me to do before i am naturally selected by starvation, bleeding out or something else like that. if i live beyond tonight, you can all pronounce me dead as of tonight. i died a very long time ago. im just putting my body to rest. 

so goodnight. if i respond tomorrow, just know youre talking to a corpse. just know youre talking to a person that became a product of this environment. just know that i, rhys gabriel, died on november 27th, 2016. so goodnight, and goodbye. i hope i see you all in a better place than this. 

to my mother: i hated how you chose him. he is garbage. to my older brother: you fucking suck as pissing in the god damn toilet. to my younger brother: single player games are much more fun. to my younger sister: get over yourself you privileged brat. to john: i really liked you, and i hope you actually do fly to mongolia or wherever and fuck shit up, youre a fucking legend man. to my dad: fuck you for keeping me alive when i am already dead you selfish bastard. to ethan: fuck off you rich ass motherfucker, we only wanted you in the band because your dad was rich enough to buy you drums and you couldnt even play them you little shit. to my stepdad: youre not my dad you lying sack of shit. to my stepmom: i dont hate you but i just dislike you enough to not enjoy your existence. to my teachers: sorry for making you grade my shit. to my first therapist: you were pretty cool but honestly you kinda sucked at helping me out but i still think youre cool. to sue: im sorry for putting you through so much shit and i think you deserve to be compensated, so you can inherit all my guitars and records, i wont need them even if i live on. to jack: honestly your gf right now is a little bit stuck up and i think you could do better. to Kiran: fuck you but also thanks i guess. to jenny: i cant forgive you for cutting off communication with me but honestly thanks for listening for the long while. to jenny: god dammit you need to fucking shave your face you fucking slob. to the girl that im rather indifferent about: im rather indifferent about you. to the girl before Dylan: your dad is an asshole but so are you. to the girl i dated last year: im still really sorry, you were like the only real person in my life and i kinda blew you off, you deserve so much better than me and i hope you find your guy or girl or whatever. to Dylan:

holy shit i could write a fucking novel for you. first off: i fucking hate your guts. you dont deserve anything other than shit, as you are the sole reason i am a walking corpse right now. second, i hope your dad tells you that youre an unreasonable bitch and that you should stop lying about your dead brother and get over yourself, and accept that you arent as fucked up as you think you are. third, for gods fucking sake, stop pretending that you are almighty and powerful, you have cancer and are gonna die in about ten years so at least enjoy your fucking life you sack of shit. grow the fuck up. fucking hate you man. 

so i guess youd like a tldr. i guess tldr: life is fucked up and i have no reason to really do anything else with my life other than die so if i dont do that tonight then i will be a corpse forever. goodnight."

GreenGirl846,5bqv7l,1478574844,Losing Hope,"I'm a little ashamed of expressing a very vulnerable time for me on the Internet, but I feel like I need to get it off my chest in a pretty anonymous way. I appreciate everyone who listens to this, and thank you for your advice.

I have been suicidal for around two years as a result of severe anxiety and depression. Although I struggle every day, I fight back the urge to kill myself because I love my family and don't want to inflict more pain than I'm already causing. However, instead of improving with time, it's become more and more unbearable to live.

I have a supportive family and numerous opportunities to succeed. My life is not the issue: it's dealing with myself. No matter how hard I try, I can't get my life together. I'm failing 2 of my 3 college classes now because I can't focus and I chose a very challenging major that I'm too stupid to handle. I have no idea what I want to do in life. I can't stick to a major or find anything that makes me passionate. I need a decent GPA to transfer to a four year college, but that is becoming an ominous prospect. My work ethic has suffered from being forgetful, scattered, and overall lazy. I don't enjoy any activities and exist in a perpetual state of anhedonia. I try to meet new people and am friendly and manage simple conversations at school, but I can't find real friends. I am always lonely and feel unwanted by everyone. Every aspect of my life is suffering from my own bad decisions and thought processes. No matter how much I try to fix my situation, I can't escape myself. I really try to find happiness again. I've been seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist for years and generally adhere to their advice, but it doesn't help. I take my medication, but nothing works.

I'm lost and trapped in life, and I can't escape. My suicidal tendencies are becoming more and more vivid and challenging to ignore. I'm trying to do the right thing, but it's so difficult to live a life in an ugly body with a stupid, lazy, uninspired mind.

SnazzyRedditName,5d4k4e,1479238824,"Drowning in shame, guilt and depression. Feeling like I destroyed my entire life.","I am 24, My girlfriend of 5 years(22) has left me. She is the mother of my son(4). I knew she was angry with me for a while, as I have not worked for a long time and she has a full time job, but I honestly didn't know the extent of her resentment she had built up to until it was too late.

Right before my son was born I developed severe sudden onset panic disorder, this was nearly half a decade ago. The experience was unimaginably hard. Every day, relentlessly i'd be overcome with extreme stress and fear to the point I couldn't even leave my house anymore, and even that wasn't enough. This went on for almost three and a half years. I developed a heavy Xanax dependency. But she was there for me the whole time. After my son was born, I was an absent-tee parent for the first year of his life, because I couldn't get a hold on myself, let alone take care of him. So she did most of the heavy lifting. And worked. And dealt with me. This made us spend less time together. I took Xanax every 6 hours at first, but this went to become way, way worse over the years. Between falling alseep from taking it, and needing to leave to take it I blew her off alot those first and hardest two years. But I started to get better eventually. But, it was because I stopped taking my meds as prescribed, and started blowing through 90 1mg pills in just a few days. I started to sleep a lot more. Some days I felt like I just couldn't keep going. I really couldn't. I didn't see any way out, I didn't see the end in sight, my suffering was constant. I don't know if I ever truly considered ending it then. But once again, my Son and my girlfriend were enough. 

Eventually... I got off of it. I put it down. Cold turkey. Stopped it for good, and that, was also an unimaginable experience. But I did it. My Anxiety went away too. I can leave now, I can go out now. And I feel now... Xanax works by making you *Not* care about things. Thats how it helps. Once I was off of it I began to realize the depths of my girlfriend's own suffering. Like sand paper to a mountain, I had worn her down. The wholetimet I was trying to fix myself she was suffering alone, doing all the work alone. Dealing with me alone. Living a dull, meaningless life devoid of enjoyment. For my sake.

By the time I realized this it was too late. So I tried to change. I did. I tried so hard to pull it all back, but she had grown so distant from me that I couldn't do anything to stop it. I began to take my son contently so she could have free time to herself. I started doing all of the things she used to suffer for. I put my anxiety and misanthropy(Mild) aside and got a job I work at 36 - 40 hours a week. But it was too late. I confronted her about her fucking around when I found things on her phone, with some guy she met at work. It was just mild stuff, flirting and some maybe pg-13 level provocative photos. But I still felt betrayed, I confronted her about it. She seemed super sorry and apologetic, Like I knew she would, I already decided to forgive her entirely, tell her how her I can change, if it's for her. But it was too late. She's gone now. She was my first, my only. I don't know if I'm an old-school guy or if it's anything else. I've only had eyes for her. I built my days based around her. I don't know how to spend my time. I don't know how to spend my money, when she;s not here. Even now, it's obvious she left now, because I was in a position to finally care for myself, she sacrificed everything for me. and now I see it. Every time I do something good, the words play in my mind. ""You're too late, this is all too late. Getting off the Xanax was too late. Caring at the level you should was too late. Being a dad was too late. Trying to overcome you anxiety and get your job was too late. You're too late. You were too late. Too late. Too late."" I'm falling back into that dark place I was 5 years ago. I can't go back there. I won't. I try to tell myself, leaving my son would be the worst, you can't do something crazy. But it makes me feel even more ashamed. I can't live without her. and I cant live knowing how entirely I destroyed her. She lives literally within shouting distance from me, I always thought it was a good thing. Now all I think about is how much time she spent waiting. how much she waited for me. How much she TRIED to spend time with me, and I blew her off. Because I knew she'd always be there. But she's not now. Every day I consider it. Every day it gets easier to think about. It would be easier if I were gone. That Psychotic break took everything from me. Even now it's taking everything. I can't live with the guilt I feel. I don't see any end to my suffering. I can't see another way out. This is a last resort. I feel ashamed even having to write this, but trying to be strong for everyone else not to worry about me is taking it's toll too. I just can't live with what I've done. I'm sorry if this doesn't seem as severe as I am making it, I am rushing alot, because even now I can't stop crying. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel the end calling. I don't know how much longer I can manage it honestly, I'm not doing so good now. I can't ask anyone for help, because I don't want them to suffer for me. And I don't want to admit so shamefully, I'd even think about it, when I have a son to take care of. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. It's not as if my heart has been broken, it's like it's gone. Completely gone entirely. I don't know how long I'd be able to go on living like this. Each day feels longer. I just want it to be over. My pain, but also the pain I've inflicted on others for my own sake. 


EDIT: I confronted my fears and and guilt. I spoke to my son's mother and got to hear that she doesn't hate me and I can still makes things right. I told my parents I have been suicidal, and instead of being angry, they helped me. Thanks to the people on here too. I think I'll manage somehow now.

its_raining_today,5axdn9,1478187192,"Worried about two of my friends, just got some questions about how I can best help.","First of all, I just discovered this community and I have to say, these resources are amazing. To the mods and anyone else involved in putting this sub up and keeping it running, thank you.

I've got two friends I'm pretty worried about. I'm also worried that they may potentially find this so I don't wanna go in to too much detail, sorry if things might seem vague at points, I'm witholding some stuff.

With one, he's been assessed as a suicide risk in a way I don't fully understand, but is telling us, his friends, not to worry. I don't think he's attempted to do it yet, but he took steps towards it at one point and backed off. He's thankful to have support but isn't initiating a process of opening up, which seems to be the context of the resource on talking to people at risk. I'm guessing the right decision here is to just wait, but I'm not sure and just feel it's best that I ask. 

The second is a bit more of a challenging situation for me. I do my best to listen and not judge, but he frames everything as some sort of philosophical argument. He still acknowledges it as an emotional thing, but really plays that aspect down and tries to justify it by talking about how life is inherently meaningless anyway and that we'e all just cogs in the machine. He says it's irrational that he hasn't killed himself yet. And, well, before I knew any better, I'd engage on that level and argue. I've convinced him of some things and we've agreed to disagree on others, but I don't think I'm getting through to him on an emotional level with how our dynamic is. 

I'd love some advice on how I could change that, but also on how to maneuver around the way he sets the tone of the discussion as this arms' length conversation about big ideas, or if I should even try to."

Prior to that I had some issues with depression and anxiety, though since I've been diagnosed with a myriad of other illnesses including schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, and depressive bi-polar. Only after these past 6 months did I realize there is a direct correlation between my head injury and my mental illness. Every day is worse than the last. Every night the nightmares get worse. I'm so dug into my sadness and self pity that I don't see a way out. On top of that my mental illness is what caused the most traumatic break up of my life. She wants nothing to do with me. I'm too much for her, my parents, or even my old friends. She was the only spark of happiness I've had that I can remember. It may seem foolish. Everyone tells me it's just young love. But it's been months and she's moved on. And all I do is dream about her leaving me all over again for that other guy. All I think about is how she is laughing and experiencing happiness with someone else. I can't get my mind off of it no matter how hard I try. And now I finally have a plan that will work. I've tried overdosing in the past but have only ever ended up in the hospital. Those are my worst regrets. Not completing my suicide attempts. But this time I have a plan with minimal pain and quickness. I made a note. And I'm just waiting to act on it. I need something. Something other than these empty words of encouragement everyone gives me telling me ""it gets easier."" I can't see myself loving anyone again and if that's the cause for me leaving than so be it. I just want a reason to continue. I want to be happy. I don't want to hurt my family by hurting myself but I see it as my only way out. I'm scared and apathetic all at the same time. Please help. "

Bye."" she replied with, ""I wish you would stop this."" I grabbed my joggers made a knot at the end so it tied together and put it on the door and closed it. I then climbed on a chair and put my joggers twice around my neck and kicked the chair away. My sister was still up and heard the chair so she checked on me. I was probably hanging for a minute by then. She let me down and I put up a fight, begged her to let me die, and did some ufc moves so I couldn't move. She ended up calling 911 and they came handcuffed me took me to the emerge. I slept, ate breakfast and lunch, talked to a shrink who I convinced to let me out, making sure I come to see a counsellor there tomorrow morning, ask to be admitted in the psych if I wanted.

Currently I'm in my 30s. Well paid job, nice place to live, girlfriend. It just doesn't work for me, I'm struggling to find happiness. I have no friends and it's damn difficult to find friends the older I get. I have a hobby that I find no time to pursuit, since majority of my life I spend at work that is slowly grinding me down. I shit you not, I can see more grey hair by the day.

My girlfriend is nice, she's really good to me, but I don't love her any more. I don't want to split up, because then I will be completely alone. My family is living in a different country, but I don't want to visit, because I'm the black sheep. My closest relative passed away nearly a year ago.

There isn't a day when I contemplate suicide. I had attempts in the past, but now it seems like the only option. I've never felt so lonely before. Never felt so trapped and hopeless. I don't know what to do anymore but I know this is bad for me, so I ask strangers for help."

Before you say hanging alone might not kill you, I'll be falling about 15ft before it actually stops, so I'll definitely be dead. I've already started to plan out my note, my final messages to friends, and my final meal. I feel like there are only two things stopping me at this point, something in my life gets dramatically better right away, or I get admitted to the psych ward. I posted here over a year ago and I promised that if I bought the stuff needed for my suicide I would admit myself, but I'm having a hard time doing it. The reason being, and please don't laugh at me for it, is the only thing that brings me any happiness or joy are on my iPod, which are music and a couple online friends. The problem is, psych ward don't allow any devices. I feel like I'll fucking fall into madness if I can't have at least music, it's the only thing keeping me sane. I guess what I'm trying to say is; please convince me to admit myself if you think my life is worth living, and if not, this may be my final Reddit post ever. I'm 17, transgender, poor, and my mental illnesses cripple me. I can't take this anymore, every day my anxieties and depression gets worse and I only see my shit ever getting sorted out in 15 years if I'm lucky.

**Edit/Update:** thank you all so much for the support, it's truly meant so much to me. I'll be speaking with my Councillor tomorrow and most likely admitting myself to the ward later this week. The support of everyone who has commented and PMed me had helped me so much and truly touched my heart, I cannot thank y'all enough! It's nice to know that there are people out there who actually want me to stay alive, and aren't even obligated in any way to feel/say so."
TheGoldenDickHat,5b1j0r,1478231746,I really think I've had enough here.,"I honestly believe I am at my limit of my tolerance towards life and the shit it loves to throw in my face. Just when I think I'm about to recover from it all, I fall right back to square one. 
So I've already posted here once and since then,  a few people inspired me to seek help (which I did). I found a job, a girlfriend and a group to go to. However, two weeks ago, I went to the hospital for a ulcer and I was also told I might have stomach cancer but I had no cancer. Kinda wish I had it now though. 
So when I got back to work, everything was normal til we had to do some stupid monthly piss test for drugs. I specifically told my boss ""I'm on some pills that my doctor prescribed to me; so if anything comes out wonky, that's why"" Then handed him a list of said medication. Well, that apparently went though one ear and out the other because upper management got a hold of those results. As in the middle of one turn somebody comes and gives me my ""Termination Papers"" because I'm a ""Liability to [their] company's infrastructure and integrity due to [my] overindulgence in narcotics"" 
So I'm back on my ass again, broke as fuck, looking for the elusive unicorn known as employment. 
The second act comes when me and my (now ex) girlfriend gets in an argument with over politics. (I'm a Republican). So she leaves and sleeps with some other dude. So I just took my shit back and left. I even took her flat screen because I know she ain't gonna pay me back after I paid ALL of her bills (Essentials + WiFi + Netflix + Hulu + PlaystationPlus + groceries). Paychecks wasted on making her happy and me feeling like a desperate retard. 
The final act comes when my mom's roommate decided to try to beat my mom. So found him at his work and took a tire iron to every bone in his body. Thank Christ nobody called the cops. Lol.
So after that heroic stunt, you'd think I'd get at least a ""Thank you but you didn't have to"" Nope. I get ""Now where the fuck am I go on a live at?"" ""Here. You're living here and shithead ain't even gonna come near you."" ""You just stirred shit up with him now"" ""No. I taught him a fucking a lesson. In fact, when he comes home, I'll give him a reminder or two."" Then she just leaves and drive off to god knows where. So great. Now at least 3/4 of my world is in shit. So after a couple drunk nights and failure attempts. I'm just somewhere between buying a gun for a sure thing or seeking help...again."

But if this is ""too p-litical,"" then fine. Delete my post again and let me prove to this country how awful they all are, fighting like children over results we deal with every four years. 

What matters to me now is that I present female and I don't want to anymore because I don't want people assuming I'm a democrat (or a white girl Trump supporter)

Yeah this turned out more political than I meant to. I needed to rant before I either take my Ativan and calm down tomorrow after work (currently on an overnight) or just goddamn hang myself instead. I'll go to the ER I guess if I need to. I'm just too deep in thought and ready to give up as a form of protest; what a horrid way to die. 

So whatever. I made the attempt to reach out."

At what point will I know that I need to go? I feel I've reached it so many times already that it's hard to keep things in perspective. I've done so many awful things that I can barely admit them all to my therapist, another person who suffers because of me. It's one thing to be useless and another to be just plain gross, but to be both surely warrants death. At least now I know I'm only miserable because I deserve to be. Even this post is just a flimsy attempt to reach out to somebody for the attention I clearly don't need.

A girl I liked was killed in an accident and I was pretty fucked up. A guy in my class killed himself the next year and I couldn't really wrap my mind around what that meant. I went to college because that's what everyone expected you to do. first week of living on campus: one of the girls across the hall wakes me and my roommate up - her roommate tried to OD on pills (we got the RA and she got help). I'm making friends and decide on what to major in. Date a girl for almost year and notice all is not well, we break up - and now it all starts to go to shit. She threatens to kill herself, I come over and talk her down. she does it again, i come over and try to talk to her but her roommates say I need to go (they call the police that night and apologize after). the third time pays for all: I spent hours looking for her after she stops by, calling our friends, and talking to her on the phone. get police involved after I find her (still alive). downward spiral begins. what is wrong with me? why can't I get past everything? everyone else is fine! finally get so scared that I'll do something to myself I tell a friend (same RA who helped with OD) and I start going to counseling. after many months they finally convince me to get on medication, which is an absolute clusterfuck. read the side effects for depression meds sometime if you get the chance. basically ""let's try this one! at X starting dose then we'll increase the dosage and see what happens! starting to feel worse? next medication!"". *lots of shit happens during this time, but everything from this point on get pretty hazy due to the constant medication and alcohol* but at one point I make a piss poor attempt to die. call therapy person and I go to a treatment center. I'm there for one weekend and let back out. I just barely graduate thanks to some really great teachers that I confess my issues to. (I still feel like I cheated or something by going to them). on and off different medication I move to another city in a different state for the job I had. meet amazing girl and things are going ok for me! I really like this person. I travel for a few months and all the dark comes in and I feel how utterly worthless I am, she doesn't really like you she doesn't know all these terrible things about me. get damn near black out drunk and cheat on her while I'm halfway across the country. I move back to home state while breaking her heart. here we are a few years later and tonight I just can't keep this all in anymore. I go to work just to get home so people won't see how bad I really am. I think of all the people I used to talk to and how I pushed some away and also how they never took the time to reach out to me. it all shows how fucking worthless I am. I don't deserve happiness. I've thought about suicide every day for the past 5 or so years during and after the events described. I've sabotaged any decent relationship I've had. I am a despicable human. I hate myself. part of me believes that if I die that will make up for all the bad things I've done and people I've hurt. 
I'm sorry to have wasted your time reading this, I made it as condensed as I could and I'm pretty sure I fucked some part of it up as I typed, I've been reading messages on here for months and finally got the stones to post something. It's getting harder for me to see what the point of fighting is anymore - nobody wants me here. "
[deleted],5dxwpn,1479646713,Exhausting,"I feel like I've always been suicidal, for as long as my short term brain can remember. I'm suffering from a few mental disorders (diagnosed w/ severe depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder) and this year has been the icing on the cake. I've become so much more isolated and the anger has gotten out of control where I have to leave work constantly because I can't stop shaking and yelling. I only can manage working 2 days a week and I spend the rest of my time on my laptop for ~10 hours a day/5 days a week. I've gotten rid of all social media and my phone because I don't talk to anyone, my mom is my only support. I've been debating on getting a new psych and therapist, but my anxiety and trust issues are getting in the way. 

I had a few attempts in the past (2011, 2014, 2016) one of which was at my workplace. My actual plan is to end my life on my 30th birthday. This date has stuck with me for a few years now. I don't know 100% if I'll go through with it, I'd much rather just die via accident or murder so I wouldn't hurt my mom with the thought of her daughter killing herself. She is shining with health so if I were to wait until she unfortunately dies I would already be much past my date. 

On a happier note, I did adopt a cat earlier this year. The only time I feel anything is when I look at him. In part, I think he is my lifeline. It's kind of silly...

"
1justmadeusername,5bjw6q,1478487820,Why bother...,"I don't know what to do... I just can't be happy... It feels like all the happiness I'll have in my life is just used up, drained away, and I'll never get any more. I've been severely depressed since I was 10 years old, with only occasional moments of happiness, but they came less and less often as I grew older, and it's now been years since the last. Now I don't know if I'll ever be happy again...

I live alone. I hardly ever go out, and when I do all it does is remind me why I do so rarely. I don't have any friends whatsoever. I never really have had any better than a few acquaintances, plus a couple of girlfriends in high school, but that was years ago. I don't know what's wrong with me. Probably some combination of being horrendously shy, anxious, awkward, quiet, ugly, a jerk, you-name-it... I'm such a loser and I hate myself for it...

Once I had dreams to be an author, or a doctor, but those have been gone for as long as I've been out of school. And now I really don't want to go back anymore. All the students seem pretentious, all the classes sound boring. The short time I was in college I found it incredibly dull, no real challenge or critical thinking, just an attempt to shepherd a bunch of children pretending they're adults into a job they'll inevitably grow to hate... I used to write music too, but I can't seem to find joy in that anymore either. It all comes out wrong, and I can't seem to write about anything other than how sad I am.

Ive tried drugs, but they don't seem to help. Antidepressants always make me feel worse. Alcohol does too. Weed just makes me either tired or anxious. Benzos do all of nothing. Stimulants make me feel, not happy, but a bit less unhappy, for a short time, followed by a long time of being absolutely miserable. I've tried therapy; I've been through so much (and such extreme forms) of it, all to no avail, that I'll never be able to trust another therapist again. I think I must have something really irreversibly wrong with my brain chemistry (aside from the obvious things like depression).

Every day feels like a chore just to get to the end of it. I try watching comedy, but I haven't laughed in years. I'm just sad... I really don't see the point of going on... People have told me that I'm young, and things get better when you get older, but I don't really see how they could; I don't have any ambition, drive, or goals anymore, and even if I did, it wouldn't make me happy. Moreover, it hardly seems worth it to keep going for that much more time. I can't think of anything that actually would make me happy... Really, I don't think I consider happiness a possibility anymore. It would be great just to not feel like shit all the time...

I've been giving serious thought to committing suicide... I don't believe in an afterlife or reincarnation or anything like that, but I really think it may be the only way to escape this awful feeling that people call life... I just call it hell.

I'm not sure why I wrote this... I'm not trying to reach out to someone, nor am I trying to show anyone they're not alone. I'm not asking for help or advice, because I don't think I can be helped. I'm just selfishly taking up a page on the internet with my life story... I guess I've just wasted your time, reader... Sorry about that..."
Sh3lf1sh,5e92dl,1479792575,Religion,"Religion fucked me up real bad. For a while, I was diehard Christian, buf now that I think about it, I was right before I was religious. Why would God put someone like me on this planet? Someone who can't even stand up without almost passing out. Someone who can't move their arms without excruciating pain. Someone with extreme tremors. I hate my existence, and if god is real, he's an asshole. I used to hold myself back because suicide is a sin in the bible, but now that I got over that fear, nothing is stopping me."
arandomuser421,5ds0cl,1479553530,I fail at everything... literally everything I try to do in life. I want to die.,"I'm almost 40.  There is no point to life.  I have tried so hard, and I live in a shoebox with 2 square feet of space (I'm only exaggerating slightly).  A prison cell would have more room.  I have no job (I've never had a real job).  I have no friends (I've never had friends).  I've never been invited to any parties.  EVER.  In my life.  From 4 years old to now.  Never.  For about 2 months not even my family would talk to me.  My parents are beyond psycho.  My mother threatened to murder me (seriously) when I was a child.  My siblings are psycho.  They cannot get along with anybody.  Everyone in my family (except me) is constantly yelling at everyone else.  My ""girlfriend"" is bordering 300 pounds now (I'm bordering 260, but at least I am trying... and failing... to lose weight), and she doesn't really care about me, we just tolerate each other.  I have no money (I've never had money).  I have no career (I've never had a career).  I have nothing other than a quarter of a million in student debt and a worthless bachelor's degree (because nobody is going to hire me anyways) even though I have worked my ass off in school for 20 years to get a degree and have done enough school work in my life to earn 5 Ph.D.s LITERALLY.   The only friend I ever had in my life stopped speaking with me about 10 years ago, so I just talk with myself.  No joke.  I have been talking to myself for the past 10 years, since nobody else will talk to me.

I am a pretty sure I am genius, yet when it comes to things everybody is supposed to know such as ""common knowledge"", I know nothing at all.  Nobody else cares or sees that fact I am a genius.  I accomplished things years ahead of my time when I was a child.  I developed ideas in artificial intelligence that only in recent years have become known.  My parents would say, that's nice, and completely reject any possibility that they had scientific merit.  I rewrote the laws of physics about 5 years ago, now a guy in Europe somewhere they are calling a ""prodigy"" stole my idea and they are calling him the next Einstein.  They say he will win the next Nobel prize.  Me... the inventor... nothing.  Etc.... the list of things I have done and others have taken credit for is insanely long.

I lost the love of my life 10 years ago, a physicist and the most beautiful girl you have ever seen, after she married her first husband... and I came to find out years later, I think she loved me too, but I was too stupid to just go talk to her.  She divorced her husband a little over two years of marriage because he was abusive to her.  Instead of me being there for her, she suffered through years of living on her own struggling to raise a child (possibly waiting for me to come back, I don't know).  She used the idea I gave her 20 years ago (so I know she still thinks about me, or maybe she did it to torture me) to start a business with her new husband a couple year ago and now she and her new husband are millionaires (or will probably be soon).  I am dead broke, literally.  I have ZERO dollars.  I'm on the verge of getting kick out into the street.   I want to contribute to society and make it a better place, but I cannot find a way.

I am insane.  I get stuck trying to solve impossible mathematics problems.  I make ""progress"" after years of failure after failure.  My memory has been failing in recent years.  Sometimes I cannot remember what I ate for breakfast.   The list of problems and things that tortore me in my life on a daily basis goes on and on.  I  have not even scratched the surface of my piece of shit life.  I feel like life is a torture chamber.  It is here to inflict maximum pain on me.  I find it a joke when other people say they are going to commit suicide.  If they had to experience what I have experienced in my life, they wouldn't have made it past 4 years old without committing suicide.  I seriously cannot find any other way out.  I may be on the verge of possibly solving the world's most difficult mathematics problem, which would essentially be the solution to the universe, and I am simultaneously thinking about commiting suicide, because even if I did solve it, which everyone I talk to says is impossible, I'm not sure humans deserve the solution or could handle its power.  I just want to die, but I can't do it.  I am living in the worst Hell imaginable, and I cannot kill myself, because it was ingrained in me as a child that suicide is selfish, and I don't want to hurt anyone else.  I just want to be gone.  My only option is suicide and maybe it is seflish, but I will be dead so who gives a fuck.  This whole reality will cease to exist because it never existed anyways.

I came here looking for help but there are too many pussy teenagers here, nobody gives a shit about an old as dirt 40 year old.  I used up my time already.  I wasted it, completely.  I never had a childhood.  I never had a life and my life is over.  It is over.  Goodbye world."
ThiefNinja,5fnkh8,1480479281,In need of help,"Through a couple years of my life, I've felt as if no one has really wanted me around feeling that my existence is pointless. I'm only 16 and I've thought about ending my life on multiple occasions. I don't feel comfortable talking to my close friends or family about it because I don't like to deal with people on my back 24/7.  So I've come to reddit to ask for advice.  My life has been filled with being bullied by family and friends both physical and mentally.  

I think about ending it but never am capable because I'm at a young age and feel as if I can go on.  A couple years ago my cousin was killed and time and time goes by and I think about why it wasn't me instead of him.  

Sorry for such a long post,  but I really need to know if I'm just going insane.  Dealing wth both depression and anxiety.  "
lamichael19,5dl7i9,1479453943,I regret choosing life,It's been three years since the first time I tried to die.  I overdosed and while I was asleep my roommate read my note and I woke up in the hospital.  Three years have past.  I should have died then.  Everything in my life since then has been a mistake.  I bought a gun recently and am thinking of ending it quickly one day without leaving a note.  It's not depression or some disease that's making me say this.  It's my own personal beliefs.  Life just isn't my thing.
Throwaway34536534,5em3iu,1479965095,Who knew anxiety and gender identity were the most deadly things in life?,"I'm every definition of useless. At every turn, I've been baited into hope, and then screwed every time.

I feel like I'm 13 again. I have dissociative voices that scream at me in my head. I have no money, no job, and garbage community college classes that are of no help to me, and of no interest. I'm transgender, but my lesbian-turned-Catholic mother (who you would think might understand, at least a bit) refuses to so much as talk about it, and my father won't even look at me. I'm anorexic. Depressed. Full of anxiety. Alone.

Maybe if I had the motivation to do even the little things, like get up and take a shower, I could progress. Maybe even do another job application, but why bother when even retail chains and fast food places cba to hire me. After  3 months of the same classes, I'm finally getting to the point where I have the courage to look someone in the class in the eye, rather than stare downwards. Heaven forbid I actually speak. But according to everyone else, I just have to practice, and my anxiety will go away. They know nothing.

I'm beginning to believe that nobody understands, or even believes me, about half my problems. My mother constantly refuses to acknowledge any of them, but reminds me  daily that if I don't eat, I'll collapse from hunger and have to go to the hospital. She then uses 7 different masculine pronouns to describe how wonderful I am, and I go upstairs and cut myself until the pain goes away.

The other week my father took me aside and kindly told me that I needed to quit feeling sorry for myself, because people in the world don't give a shit.

So I'm going to see how much of a shit he gives when I'm dead. I've got the house to myself until 10 tomorrow, a bathtub, and a bottle of Ambien that I bought off a ""friend"" for this purpose.

I'd call the hotline, honestly, but whatever it is about phone calls, fuck 'em, they give me way too much anxiety. I also don't need them to call 911 on me (like I know they will, since I've got a plan, a time, and the means to execute it right next to me) and get me stuck in another psych ward where they'll watch me for 3 days, tell me everything is ok, give me a cute little lollypop, and go home happily thinking they made my life better. I can't afford another useless hospital bill.

I don't really care about anyone attempting to tell me I'm worth something, or that it'll be ok. This is an open letter to anyone who cares enough to read it, but its real purpose is for my father to read when he eventually gets into my computer and checks my history as I know he will.

I'm gonna go for it in a couple of hours, probly gonna get a bit drunk first just to hopefully numb what I'm about to do.

Wish me luck."

I've tried to kill myself before, unsuccessfully. I was either stopped by people or it just didn't work, cause fuck me for doing what I want, right? I hate myself for feeling this way; that I'm a pathetic mess that should just get a grip and live through the pain until I can manage it. But I know that the past few years, despite my best efforts, extensive treatment, and my deepest wishes, this has not been the case. And over this time people have stopped caring; it became apparent to them that this was my normal. I don't blame them. Fuck, if anything I wish I could ignore these feelings as well as they can.

I wish I could be happy, but I just can't. The happiest part of my day is when I go to sleep, but even those are short and restless, even my dreams are usually shit and unhappy.
I feel like an observer in my own life. I'm just along for the ride absentmindedly, while everyone else seems to know what to do.

thelostthrowaway11,5b6jma,1478296994,I already tried twice. Maybe this time the pills will work.,"I've been pushing myself for over a year now. I've had everything ripped away from me. The one person who gave me hope in this world died tragically and I couldn't do anything to stop it. From the moment I was born, I was doomed to have a terrible life. Poor looks, poor genes, predestined to die from dementia or heart disease. Then the schizophrenia came, and I began hearing voices and noises, and my dad ditched me because I was too much to handle. My mom began doing the drugs and I became the subject of every bit of hate she felt. I have PTSD and anxiety and depression from what she's done to me. The physical abuse, the verbal abuse, making sure that I was never good enough and that no one will ever love me and I'm just worthless... well good fucking job mom. You won. You broke me. The only thing I had keeping me going, that one person who truly loved me, died a year ago. That day, I died with her. I've been nothing but a walking corpse since. With no family and no friends, I honestly am surprised at how long I've kept going. Really, it was just me waking up waiting for this ""change"" people keep saying will happen. It will get better, they say. When? I've waited and waited and you know what's happened? IT'S GOTTEN WORSE.
I don't know if social media has had its rounds about me (I don't have any but everyone in school does so they are probably talking about me), but no one at school wants to talk to me and do everything they can to avoid me.  Just this morning, at my bus stop, the girls who wait with me looked at me afraid and backed away from me and sort of just stood awkwardly to avoid me. At school I try to hard to make friends. I try so fucking hard. I act super nice and go out of my way doing favors for people. Sometimes I start acting like a stupid silly kid for attention because I just want one person, anyone to just pay attention to me. I tried talking to this girl today and she wasn't even listening and just ignored me. Nobody likes me. NO ONE. I just want to be loved. I just want to be held. I just want my loved one back. But nothing is going to change. People in the halls do their best to avoid me, and others look disgusted/pissed off/hatred towards me when I talk to them. I just want this all to end. This pain is too much to bear. I have the sleeping pills right here. It will all be over soon."

ImaBipolarbear,5dvd9f,1479600072,Two heartbeats away,"I've cut until I can't cut any more. I am drained, exhausted, and so very tired of fighting this 22 year battle. I have PTSD with severe depression and anxiety - a product of childhood abuse. I've been out of work since last February when I had a nervous breakdown, and I can't get back on my feet. I don't respond well to psychiatric medications; I'm just a sick little guinea pig for my psychiatric NP. Therapy has helped some, but I am still unable to face huge upwellings of emotions like this.

I fought horribly with my boyfriend today and he is so hurt he will barely speak to me, so my emotional ""safe place"" (our home) is gone and I'm getting frantic. I am being completely financially supported by my boyfriend, which humiliates me and causes indescribable guilt whenever I think about it. I feel like I have utterly failed to be a human being, and all I've done is damage others while I damage myself. Christ, I can't even write a coherent paragraph. I am two heartbeats away from trying a lethal cocktail of pills - I have the right ones to potentially stop my breathing while I sleep. I'm running out of immediate reasons not to try. The hurt is so huge and so overpowering that all I can think about is making it stop, by any means necessary. 

Someone please help me. If I die, I will emotionally kill so many other people along with me. I just can't take the mental anguish. I feel like I'm on the edge of doing something irreversible. I don't want this to be my shitty suicide note. Please."

ThrownOut68414,5cusyd,1479108681,What to do?,"Hello, first time poster here. Im 21 years old and have been suffering from Depression since i was 15 years old, recent diagnostics were ""Malignant Narcistic Personality Disorder"" ""Clinical Depression"" and ""Schizoid Personality Disorder"" from 3 different psychiatrists. But to cut to the chase: I have been strongly thinking about just ending my life for the past 2 years, but have always tried to shake it off and see the light. I´ve been trying to find fullfillment and a purpose for my life that is anything worth working towards and havent found anything that really stuck with me. Ironically I wouldnt be socially isolated if I didnt choose to do so in preparation to make people care less about me once I´m gone. I´ve been plotting my suicide for the past 2 years, slowly phasing out of everyones point of view to make it easier on everyone that knew me. I prepared a Final Letter to make sure that people will have an easier time of letting go, and hopefully not blame themselves for what happened to me. Currently I see 2 options that I want to go ""all in"" on, one is shoving myself into the Psychiatry in hopes of actually getting ""fixed"" and patched up, and the 2nd option is the ""Plan B"" which means if I still dont see the sense in existing I want to walk towards the light. I´m pretty much feeling like dead-empty inside, I lived as a pityful NEET in my mothers house after dropping out of Uni and feel like I´m a shame to my mother and everyone that I know. I know that I could have done so much more with my life, but for some reason I didnt. And it frustrates me so much, that I cant backtrack my train of thoughts properly. Memories are always a bit sweetened up or watered down and my brain does a good job of not wanting to give me more memories to burn through and deconstruct. I feel like I dont belong here, and that the future holds nothing exciting for me anymore. I feel like my Life has peaked and am stuck in the past. Every emotion that I´m supposed to feel now, feels like a shoddy and watered down version of something that I experienced in the past. I dont enjoy anything anymore and have had the ""Kill yourself"" dialogue inside of my head at least 20 times per day for the past few years. And as of now, I dont even think that shoving myself into the Cuckoos Nest will change anything about how I am, or what I think in the long term. So ending my Life in a quick fashion should be a nobrainer here right? Sorry for rambling so hard, I just wanted to get this off of my chest."

ConcernicusT,5ffe5a,1480378910,I am concerned over my best friend's jokes about self-harm and suicide. What do I do?,"Repost from relationships, excuse the formatting.

I [25M] have a friend [26M] who I've known since 2006, all the way back in high school, and I just realized I've been homies with him for over 10 years now. Anyway, he's always been a huge joker, always pushing the envelope of what is acceptable to joke about. Some of the stuff that comes out of his mouth is downright offensive (think along the lines of 4chan humor), but we've always known that it was never serious.

We went our separate ways after high school, but always kept in touch via Facebook and other social media, as well as playing video games together. He went to University of Michigan for college, while I stayed in California. I didn't think much of it at the time, but about a year ago, he began making self-harm jokes and little quips about him going insane from loneliness. I wrote it off at the time because he's always joked about everything.

But when we hung out during thanksgiving and drank, a few suicide jokes came out. Again, none of us thought anything of it at the time, but now that I look back on it, I'm concerned. It's not like he says this stuff frequently. We'll be having a conversation or laughing about something, and one of these jokes will come out, usually related to the topic at hand. I want to stress that these jokes and quips are NOT frequent at all, but the fact that they're being said concerns me, especially since this sort of thing wasn't talked about before. One thing I did notice was that he wasn't a big drinker even after he turned 21, but the guy was able to put away a significant amount of alcohol this time around. That was a red flag to me. No self-harm scars though, at least none I can see.

I want to ask him about this, but I don't know how to do it. He has a rocky but intact relationship with his mom, but his dad was never in the picture. Additionally, he's back in Michigan for his job, so it's not like I can check in on him.

**TL;DR: One of my best friends is making self-harm and suicide jokes. I think he is joking but I feel like I should be concerned. How do I talk to him about it?**"

StonewallHaxson,5b8e9j,1478321744,"8 years of suffering and failed attempts at, well, everything, I think I'm finally done.","I'm scared. Of course I'm scared. But I don't know what else there is for me to do anymore. 

Within the past month, I lost my job, the woman who breathed fresh air into my life has left me, and I am now completely unable to afford my rent. I cannot go back to college to finish my degree, and every avenue I've pursued in my adult life I have failed at. I'm 26. 

I graduated high school a C student. I'm intelligent but i was extremely lazy back then, doing just enough to skate on through with minimal effort. I attended community college for two semesters, but dropped out after finding my best friend of 14 years making out with my girlfriend at the time, and then somehow managing to turn our entire college group of friends against me. This is when I slipped into a depression that I have never managed to climb out of.  

I bounced between jobs but could never find something that i excelled at, or enjoyed. Shortly after I turned 20, I started dating a girl I met two years previously in college. She was the love of my life. I felt that, at the time, I had no other alternatives to make myself successful like my elder brother, so I enlisted into the USAF, just like he did years prior. I met and formed friendships while in basic training, even so far as to sneak to the on base mall with them, where I purchased an engagement ring for my soon-to-be-fiancée. We had planned for us to get married, and then she could move in with me wherever I ended up getting stationed, so we could start a life together. 

One of my greatest shames came shortly after this point. I broke under the pressure, I became a coward, and I lied about migraines to get out of basic training and sent home. I missed her, I was lazy. I had no motivation. Whatever the reason, I went through with the decision and landed back in New York; home. To this very day I think about how cowardly and pathetic I was back then, to make a decision that would single handedly begin to destroy me. 

So I got a job at Walmart, my first job after 8 months of unemployment after I was separated from the USAF. I was 21, young and terrified of marriage, young and terrified of fucking up my future plans, plans I had planned out for the next few decades. Young and terrified of being with the same woman for the rest of my life. Was I ready for this? These were the thoughts going through my mind. And I'm yet another moment of weakness, I let an old high school crush pursued me to see her, where we made our. Where I massacred the trust between my fiancée and me. She found out, of course she did. They always do. And she left me. For good reason. I do not blame her, though I love her still even more than half a decade later. 

Those years from age 21 to 25 are a blur; nothing changed. My life was static. Bouncing between jobs again, unable to settle or discover what my interests were or what I was good at. Nothing. My father witnessed my increasing depression and sadness, so he suggested I move down to delaware to live with my brother and sister in law who were stationed at the base in Dover. A fresh start they said. So I did. 

My brother informed me not to worry about money or a job, just to focus on finishing my degree. So i blazed through another semester; 4.0 GPA. got the presidents list certificate to prove it. I meet my (now ex) girlfriend the first day of class here. One of the most beautiful women I've ever laid eyes upon. And she told me she fell for me the first day I sat in front of her on the first day of class. 

We get to know eachother more and more through the semester. I help carry her through her classes, I set her up with and taught her better study habits. I stayed on her about not skipping classes or homework assignments. She ended with a 3.8, something she didn't even think she was capable of. But a month prior to the end of that semester, my brother and SIL get orders to Alaska. So they have to leave in a month. Now I'm panicking, having to find s job that pays at least  $12 an hour in order to afford a mediocre apartment on the edge of the ghetto that I managed to find on such a short notice. 

So my girlfriend and i are in love. Hot and passionate and bright. She needs to get out of her toxic family home, away from her abusive father. I love this woman and I need to get her away from there. I'd do anything. So we sign a lease together. Make plans for our future. Fall in love with one another again and again and again. It's amazing. Its incredible. But it was so short. 

The job I landed was at the giant local casino. I ended up working night shift. The women i worked with, mostly middle aged, ended up making my life there a living hell. I tried so very hard. I wanted and NEEDED to convince myself that I could do this. That I could make it in the world as an adult. I turned 26 two weeks before accepting this job. But the stress proved too much, both on me and my relationship. 

I never got to see my girlfriend, because I'd sleep all day and have my sleep broken in order to drive her to work. I was tired and irritable most days, unable to take her out or do anything. We were poor, so very poor. Unable to afford to do anything enjoyable together. I could see it in her eyes. She was younger than me by 6 years. She hadn't the chance to see how depressing and hard adulthood is, she wanted to live her 20's and party and smoke some eeed and have some fun. I encouraged her. But no matter what I taught her, whether it be how to do her taxes or financing, or random household adult things, I could never really get her to see that she needed to put forth a little more effort, since she was only working part time and paying less than 1/3 of the rent. So we ended up devolving into ridiculously petty arguments that lead no where, then make up, rinse repeat. 

She finally snapped October 4th and just couldn't take it anymore and left me. Promising she still loved me but just couldn't handle a relationship anymore at this point of her life. And it hurts so much because all I wanted to do was work things out, was to try and mend it all, but she left and ran instead. 

A week before she left me, I end up in the ER due to feeling too dizzy to stand for three days straight. I didn't and still don't have health insurance, so I kept saying NO to going to the ER. I knew it would ruin me financially. But after three days of being unable to stand unassisted I caved, and went. Docs say the stress got to me and my head. Couldn't afford the mess they prescribed. Hit with a $4000 bill. A week later, I lost my Job the very same night my girlfriend left me.  

She recently moved back home and now I'm alone every single day and night here. Staring at my rifle, knowing just how easy it would be to put a bullet into the chamber and end it. Because no matter what I do. No matter what I touch or try or attempt, something happens which causes me to fail. Be it an external event, or an internal decision or failure, I cannot take it any longer. 

I miss her so much. I miss you everything about her. I miss how she looked up to me and always loved how I had an answer for all her questions. I miss her praise on my intelligence. I miss her relying on me. I miss BEING reliable. I miss all the opportunity for success I've had in my life. But I don't think I can keep it up. 

There are so many things I left out of this, so many details that paint a more vivid picture but I can't type anymore. My fingers hurt and my eyes are too watery. Every night I glance at the closet where my rifle is stored, and it scares the absolute hell out of me, but I'm at the point now where I have nothing and no one.

I will lose my apartment very very soon. I've lost the last person who loved me. My final pillar of support walked out the door and now hardly speaks to me, but tells me everything is still fine between us. 

I can't take the mental anguish anymore. I lay her nightly, fighting off that anxious, chest tightening feeling and resoluteness for hours before i can finally fail asleep from exhaustion. 


I'm just so tired of being tired. "

It was either make the call, check into hospital, or exit stage left, if you catch my drift... No other ideas; I was seriously unable to cope or stop thinking about how to get off the damn planet. 

I called, full of trepidation, and I hear a lot of horror stories from people, but I want to say that my experience was mostly positive. 

The woman I spoke with was incredibly kind, very calm, and she listened intently even though I was a total basket case. 

She didn't send anyone to my house to haul me off somewhere and lock me up. She gave me some resources and told me to call back if I couldn't get those resources in place on my own. She asked me to promise to do this; and to be safe or go to the hospital and I was able to give her my word on that and mean it, which is something I'm grateful for. 

She was there for me. I wish I could thank her more for what she does. It is very important, taxing work that most people could never ever do. 

I just wanted to share. This place is awesome but sometimes you need more help. It's ok. 

I made it through the day. It was an awful mess of a day. I really hate some of the things that happened recently. I feel helpless and scared, but slightly less suicidal.

I don't feel real. Nothing around me feels real. I am like in a glass box and everything around me is as illusion. It just doesn't feel real. Not my thoughts, emotions, memories, body, nothing. The only excitement I get is from daydreaming. Only then things feel real. My head is just constant static. I am disconnected. 

I am full of so much anger and hatred and emptiness for seemingly no reason. I feel like a mirror, or a shell, or a mould. Or just nothing. I don't feel like anything. I find life so pointless and meaningless. I hate everything. I want everyone including myself to die. I just hate everything. 

I won't die now or maybe not even in a few years unless I'm desperate but I know it's going to happen. If there's one thing I believe in it's that once someone decides they want to die, it's very difficult to change their mind. "
under_cross,5etfcj,1480078337,Death is still my best friend,"I'm not in debt anymore. I have a house. I have a wife. I am willing to start a family with her. I have a car and a job. I have a TV... Pc.. smartphone.. tablet... Dishwasher... Dryer and clothes washer... I have a normal life one should be lucky to have and happy to have.

Despite this... I have no friends. I am unable to connect with anyone due to my aspergers... Social anxiety... Major depression and anxiety...

I have tried in the past to kill myself on 2 occasions and failed...

Things are seemingly good at the moment but I always have than splinter in my head... Driving me insane...

Over worrying about how shit of a father I will be.. when the next wave of debt will hit me... When my wife will get fed up of me and leave me for someone stronger... When my car is gonna break down causing me more unexpected expenses I am unable to save for...

It never goes away. I'm always worrying. I'm always having a good day... And when I go to sleep I get horrific nightmares I never wake up from... I have to endure it until the morning... And spend the day wondering why I had that nightmare.

I'm on meds... Shrink visits... And I can honestly say nothing works. 

No matter what I always remember the bad things... The traumatic childhood... The beatings at school... The friends who betrayed and left me.. the cheating girlfriend who I considered marrying before this one now..

I just wish I could find my bully from school and murder him... Divorce my wife... Murder my parents... Go fuck a sexy hooker with big tits and do some meth... Or heroin.. and then jump off a bridge and be done with it all...

What's the point in any of this... If I can't feel happiness or feel normal like everyone else?

I'm sitting in the car at work... Listening to some good music and vaping... With no debt... A wife... a house... A job... But I could not be more miserable if I tried.

I guess it all started when I met this wife of mine. All she's done is cost me money. Fine she's lovely and I love her but... Marriage fucking costs... I'm so fucking sick of being poor... Having nothing for myself... And she waltzes home ""hey look at these cool make up things I bought"".... Grrrrr...

Fuck it. Not all humans are cut out for this life. Some win.. some lose.. and I'm ok with that.

I dunno if I will try die again... Maybe 3rd time lucky. Who knows... Maybe something good will happen and I won't feel like this anymore...

But so many good things happened and I am still a miserable wreck.

Fuck me. I hate me. I hate that I ever was made and brought into this world."
markoctavio,5c7iel,1478779902,Sadness Song - Current 93,"When we touch the world
Just to fall apart
And our mother lies in state
And the broken pitcher glistens
And the snow is at the window
Making neither sign nor symbol
And the earth covers earth
And the mud lies in pools 

Where the sand-dunes stretch unbroken
And the dry wind bends and sighs
And the geese are running harmless
And our desires are running wild
When we're looking at the smoke
That's rising from the incense
Neither coming here nor going
Neither heaven here nor hell
Neither borning here nor birthing
Neither dying here nor death 

And we're wrapped inside our troubles
And we're wrapped inside our pain
And wracked with fires with longing
And our eyes are blind with night
With our fingers clutching coins
And our thoughts burning with 'I'
And our eyes cannot be sated
With the world and its nightmares
With the world and its dreams
Though later they'll be filled
With a small handful of dust
And the gods appear on altars
And we recognize their face
It's a face that we have carved there
And it's full of fear and longing
And promises and threats
But they neither stoop to conquer
Nor do they stoop to praise
And the mines are void of diamonds
That we carry in our rags 

And all the world seems
A sadness song
All the world seems
A sad sadness song"
ImnotfamousAMA,5bzy7n,1478681590,Anger Management is Hard,"As of the time I'm posting this, it's nearly 4 am. Everyone I would usually go to for this is asleep and I'm left hoping someone can help me

Lately, I've been trying to control my anger. I usually lash out at people and say things I don't mean due to stress. I always sorta blamed my dad because he does the same thing, but I recently came to the conclusion it wasn't fair for my loved ones to bear this burden just because I lack self control. 

So I try and control it. I don't yell, I don't say stupid shit I know I will regret the moment I come to my senses, and I bury it. And as I'm writing this at 4 am, that anger became something else. A deep, dark emptiness I have been trying to control for years now. It's like that Owlturd comic where he removes the mask from anger and there's only sadness underneath. 

I probably don't have to tell you guys what it's like. I'm lying in bed alone, wondering why I was even born. Why even bother? I've never accomplished anything, and the one thing I did build myself every one was better off the moment I stepped away from it. I hate begging for attention like this from strangers, but I don't want to put my loved ones through my stupid problems. I've done enough damage to them for lifetime."

i'm gonna die, i'm gonna die. it just goes on and on and on and i can't take it. i sent angry messages to my ex. because he did me wrong worse than she did, worse than my dad did, worse than the guy who tried to rape me did. eddie, you're the worst person i ever met. is it a good day in oregon? you were the reason for my third suicide attempt. but we both know, you never cared about that kind of thing. 

what the fuck am i supposed to do. i want to drink until i throw up. i haven't slept in nearly 24 hours. i have an essay deadline in half an hour and i'm not going to submit it. it was already an extension. all i fucking want, is something. just give me something. give me a year where i don't want to die. give me just a month where i feel happy. i don't remember what happy feels like. i wasted my whole summer studying for the most important exam of my life, and when i finally found out i passed it, i felt nothing. i'm dead inside. but i'm a good person. i swear to god, i promise, i'm a good person. that was my whole thing. especially after i got ill. if i have to be this sad, forever, just because of who i am, then i don't want other people to be sad. i swear to god, i just want to help people. i always just wanted to help people. eddie, that's why i stayed with you so long. because i wanted to help you so much, i cared so fucking much about helping you that i didn't see what you were doing. it never gets any easier. it only gets harder. it's my decade anniversary with the monster in my head. there is no solution.

throwawayOKOkay2,5c7s78,1478784126,Feeling suicidal but have a job interview today. Need your advice!,"Hey, everyone! I've been lurking here for ages, and I really appreciate what you do. The long and the short of my situation is I've been thinking about suicide for a while now -- not sure how long -- and recently the thoughts have become more frequent. It honestly scares me, so last night I took what I consider the first step on my road to recovery, which was telling my best friend about it.

I decided, with her help, that I should talk to a suicide hotline today. Trouble is, I have a job interview scheduled for, like, 5 hours from now. I already rescheduled it (It was supposed to be yesterday, but I was feeling so out of sorts because of the election that I rescheduled it to today). I don't feel comfortable rescheduling again. And, anyways, what am I going to say? ""Sorry, can't do it today. I'm feeling a touch suicidal""?? My friend said, while I shouldn't say that, my situation is a legitimate medical situation, and I am therefore justified in lying. Part of me thinks I should just let the whole thing drop. Just not go to the interview. Don't go call. Anything. Just let it be. But am I thinking that because I don't want the job or because of my social anxiety? Do I have an obligation to just ""suck it up"" and go to the interview today? Honestly, I'm not sure I can do that. What should I do???

Again, thank you all so much for what you do. This is my first post, so I hope I've followed all the rules..."

She was passed out but it appeared that there was no damage. How long will they keep her in the hospital/psych ward? I haven't heard back.
One of my friends who also did hanging was only in there for two days. But I heard the usual is three days. How long would she probably be there? We're in the US by the way (NY specificially.)"
Dester1,5b6ql2,1478299169,"I could never do it, but its hard holding it all in.","If i were to give some back story, it would sound like a lot of people situations, I grew up with parents who constatly broke up and got back together, and even emotionally abused me. My friends kinda just faded away and I got new friends, but most importantly, i never got help, and i dont have anyone to talk to.

I have an older brother who was constantly getting in trouble, he was dealing drugs at the time, and he recently just got out of jail, i looked up to him, and took his advice, then my parents manipulated me into hating him, ruining my relationship with the only person who ever taught me street smarts.

Ive never been ""good"" at anything, my parents never could afford to keep me in a sport for more than a year or 2, and by the time i was getting back into it i lost interest. they never enhanced my abilities and hell they never even gave a shit about my school, its like they expected me to fail and just go straight to work. 

It sucks not being able to get the support i need, and I want to just forget everything and move on, but I literally have nothing, no worth not even a helping hand to get me started. I'm 19 and i feel like ive reached the end of my life already, I dont have a girlfriend to talk to or share anything with, and my friends just give me the same garbage that everyone says, ""ohh it'll get better"", ""just keep your head up"". THAT SHIT DOES WORK

Ive tried it, ive looked at the positives, i tried to be optimistic, but I just cant anymore, I NEED HELP, Ill never be able to kill myself, but maybe some kind of accident would be best. that way people wouldn't think that I Wanted attention. Yeah, that seems like the best way to go. Just make it seem like an accident.

I just want to forget, but i dont want people to forget me, I have done so much for others, and for my own mother to call me selfish, sometimes i would just wish she would get out of my life, but since that wont happen, guess i just have to get out of hers.

Others say I'm too high risk for the same thing.

dorianfinch,5ff23b,1480375285,"Not going to do it, but I think about it constantly now.","I'm 25 and I've danced around the topic of suicide on and off for the last maybe 13 years. I've made two half-assed attempts when I was 19 but never since then. This year has just destroyed me. 

My already-dysfunctional relationship with my family (I only have four immediate family members, of which two are already estranged) basically disintegrated this year. Kind of needed it, as my father is abusive, but as he is also in his 70s and in poor health and living alone, I am still racked with guilt.

A four-year relationship with someone I considered the (cliche) love of my life fell apart and they're already out there meeting new people and so on, and it hurts. Especially since they are my best friend, so normally I would go to them with my problems buuuuut now it's too weird and awkward and intimate to do with my ex. Plus I'd be afraid if I confided in them about my mental issues they'd think I was trying to guilt or manipulate them into feeling bad for breaking up with me.

The thing is, I have a lot of other (not super close) friends and acquaintances, and support. I know lots of people would be devastated if I died. I have a therapist, a psychiatrist, and three different kinds of medication that work arguably ok, or did anyway until recently. Besides, hard to say if what I'm feeling now is related to brain chemistry or just my life kinda sucking right now. I dunno if it's worth the effort to keep putting up with my depression just to make these other people happy. I've done that all my life and I kind of feel like I'm being held here against my will. I just want to leave already. Maybe this is what evolution is, maybe I just haven't got what it takes to survive, you know?

Either way, I have things to do before I go. And I keep setting further deadlines, so I know I'll never actually commit suicide. ""Well, I can't die before Thursday, because I have to play a show that night. Can't die before March, because that's my album release. Can't die before April, that's my college roommate's wedding."" And so on, and so forth, and by the time April rolls around I'll a reason to postpone till June, and so it goes.

And yet, these goals are starting to seem less and less necessary to complete.

Last few weeks were looking good, had 3 interviews for a job. Two over the phone and 1 in person. Haven't heard from the ones who called me and most likely won't. Heard today from the interview I did in person. They liked me, but said I just did not have enough experience. By the way there are people who work there where I went to college who I worked with.

I feel like a god damn failure. I told my mother and she said the reason they did not hire me was because they must have looked at my facebook account and saw the political posts I posted. I freaked out on her, yelled at her, and said that is the most bat shit insane reason to think of considering they probably couldn't even see my facebook account. Whether or not they would give a shit what I posted on there.

I just want to drink although the last time I got really sad and drank a lot, I went to the hospital I guess because of alcohol poisoning. I feel alone and can't seem to dig myself out of this hole.

She is musically and artistically talented, she is absolutely beautiful and i love her to pluto and back.

My girlfriend is extremely depressed, she finds it extremely hard to go to school and is probably about 4 times a week in tears just from how much she hates it. Even more worryingly about 4 days ago she let her frustration out on her wrists...School wont help, her parents wont help.

illuminator_reborn,5fm3o9,1480462239,Maybe I do have a problem...,"I wake up most days wanting to kill myself. It's not even a concious decision and there's nothing immediate that triggers it. I just wake up every day wanting to kill myself.

We all have to die one day, why does it matter today or tommorrow? Would you rather be in control of your death, or would you rather be subject to the fact that at any minute now you could drop dead from a heart attack or a stroke? Or worse yet, suffer through cancer or some other horrible terminal disease.

My Mom had cancer and it was litterally the worst experience I've ever seen anyone go through. She couldn't eat, and anything she did eat she would throw up straight away. When she was done throwing up whatever she ate, she would start throwing up green bile. She became a skeleton of a woman and a shell of what she used to be.

She was paralysed and unable to basically do anything with her life, except be in constant pain and suffering.  She couldn't even take normal opiate painkillers,  because essentially they interefered with a function that was already fucked up.

I constantly have to make a decision over how I am to live my life, why is it such a leap that I should want to choose how to die?

I can give justifications as to why, but mostly it seems to fall on deaf ears or meets opposition, simply because you value your life more than mine. SOmeone out there is always recommending I seek the help of a professional. The same professionals that work in an industry that consistently, and legally violates the most basic human rights, simply because someone acts in a way that is unacceptable or not understood.

Or stuffs ineffective and poisonous medicaitons down our throats. Medications that are being questioned everyday because of a faulty model of reasoning and already debunked hypotheticals. And if I don't take these medications? I'm seen as being unreasonable.

Then of course, there's the guilt train. What about those who love me? I don't have any friends or family. There all dead. I have no one to love, and no one loves me. There would be no guilt, it would just be a passing of another anonymous schlub.

So do I have a problem or don't I?"

Then she out of the blue broke up with me...
Said she loved me but wasnt in love with me.

I feel so wronged, because i love her too much to be able to move on. She's gonna find someone to replace me, and forget all those things i did with her that she said she would never do with anyone else. 

I can never be as close to someone again, i'm too afraid of being hurt like this again. Not that it matters because no one is going to like me, i'm never going to find someone as perfect as she was, especially that would love me back.

I told myself i would never try to kill myself again, it hurt too many people the last time...but it hurts me too much to carry on, knowing shes gonna be happy without me.

aeromajor227,5bvs5o,1478637509,"Every step ""forward"" that I take in life I find myself less happy with it all. (X-Post /r/depression)","Sorry in advance for the long post. 

I miss college...  I miss having an immediate and clear purpose in life.  I had concrete goals then, and consistent short term deadlines whether they were the quarter, the end of the school year, or the ultimate goal of graduation.  I had more friends there then I knew what to do with.  I had no money and dreamed of having a ""real"" income...  My freshman year I didn't even have a car...  And yet overall I was so much more content with life than I am now. 

I am about a year and a half into industry post graduation...  I have money, I have my own place, I have a nice car...  But I feel like other than these meaningless ""things"" I truly do not have as much..  What I had then couldn't be measured by dollar signs or possessions...  What I had was meaning..  Purpose...  Happiness.  

I had to move from LA to San Diego for my job...  And instead of making a group of friends down here...  I rushed into what became a dysfunctional relationship.  Fast forward a year and that relationship inevitably came to an end...  About 3 weeks ago now.  I don't have a group of friends to fall back on..  I don't have a social life to resort to...  I don't even have a roomate to talk to.  I've been spending all my free time sleeping, up to 16 hours in a day.  I come to work...  Eat a salad...  Sit at my desk then go home feed my cat sleep and rinse and repeat during the weekdays.  I feel like my life is going nowhere..  Every day I feel like breaking down and crying despite lacking the emotional energy to do so.  How can I be succeeding financially and professionally while feeling like a complete failure? I don't want to hurt myself...  But every day I have images of doing just that.  I used to find my relief in a bottle but I am now recovering and have almost six months of sobriety under my belt...  I know alcohol doesn't solve anything but my existence has been all the more unbearable when left alone with my thoughts...  No alcohol induced haze to dull their sting in my mind.  

I wish I could go back.  I even find myself looking all the way back to high school and thinking of how easy and fun things were.  I don't know what my place is in this world.  I have so many ideas so many visions...  But lack the coordination or attention span to follow through with them. I feel like I am constantly staving off the onset of madness. 

This falls in line with the ending of my relationship..  As much as I am lonely...  What scares me more is the fact that I feel I might just be a scatter brained and emotionally anguished intellectual for the rest of my stay on this earth.  I feel like I would rather not have potential and live up to what I was capable of than have such potential and such ideas, visions, inventions...  Just to be tortured by the cosmic joke of never being able to achieve them.  

TL;DR: I think I need to get help.  I find myself continuing on a downward trend of self worth and happiness thst began five years ago.  I have suicidal thoughts on a daily basis, to the point where they have lost their shock factor and are no longer disturbing.  I have everything I thought I wanted when I was in college...  But find myself wishing I could give it all up to have the happiness and purpose I felt 5 years ago."

thrutheway,5dqaqz,1479521160,"Close friend feeling suicidal, unsure of what to do","Hi,

Im a guy, 19, currently at uni in England, I met this girl about 6 weeks ago, honestly the most amazing girl, beautiful, funny, amazing taste in music and we just get on so well together. We started dating pretty quickly after we met and spent all of our time together just chilling, watching movies, going shopping, just having a great time. 

She keeps in contact with her of 3 years, he constantly emotionally abuses her over past grievances between them and it really takes a toll on her. She tells me she has been depressed for over 10 years now and that she feels like she is never gonna be happy, that happiness is only temporary with her. She messaged me around 3 and a half weeks ago, her ex had been particularly mean to her about a certain personally event they went through. She told me how bad it made her feel, she told me how she set up a rope to hang herself with and showed me that she had cut all of her wrist up. 

She came round to mine a bit after that and I did my best to make her feel better, she left with a smile on her face however she still told me she felt bad. 

Well today she broke up with me, saying how she still loves her ex and she never loved me. I've been talking to her throughout the day and everything seemed to be going alright, we still want to stay friends as we get along so well but just not date anymore. About an hour ago she messaged me saying how she wants to hurt herself, saying that she will never be happy and she just wants to die. I feel that she calmed down and has now gone to bed but the whole thing really scared me, I couldn't bear to lose her and I want to do anything I can to help her even though she says I cant do anything to help.

If any of you could maybe give me some advice on how to reach out to her I would really appreciate it!"
ladybeni,5d66ix,1479256127,"Intrusive Thoughts of Self-Harm and Suicide, along with a calm feeling that my life is worthless","I am 26 year-old grad student. I have long had anxiety (bouts of OCD, anorexic symptoms, panic attacks, and some social anxiety). In 2012, I experienced my first serious depressive episode, in part triggered by an abusive supervisor. But, I got through that! I thought I was cured. I though it would never happen again.

Now, here I am again. For the first time, my depression and anxiety are having tangible and measurable effects on my life. I am missing meetings, classes, and deadlines. My performance is not up to my usual standards. I used to be able to keep my anxieties and depression hidden, and segment it from the rest of my life. But not now. 

I look around and see so many capable, wonderful, kind, and intelligent people. I see people around me who are valuable, who are making a difference. And over the course of the past few months, I have come to the conclusion that I am worthless. I can never contribute anything significant -- not even to one single person. Any of my friends could have a better friend than me. My partner could have a better partner than me. My discipline has better scholars than me. I add nothing. I am worthless, and no matter how hard I try, I cannot improve. I don't want to be the best, it is okay if I am not the best, I will never be the best. BUT, I want to be of some value to someone or something. But I am not. 

For the past few months, intrusive thoughts of self harm and suicide have plagued my mind. Sometimes, I can barely see through the fog of these negative thoughts. And, I have hurt myself. Worse than I had in the past.  

The more I think about my life, the more pointless and meaningless it seems. The main thing stopping me from ending things now is my partner and my family. I never want to hurt them, and loosing me would hurt them. But in the end, I do not think I truly add something valuable to their life. 

In case you are wondering, I am in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and tried taking various SSRIs (antidepressants), but they had horrid side effects for me. 

I am sorry to be so negative. I just feel like I need to express these feelings. Thank you for reading and for your support. 

Warmly, 
Lady B.  "

pokesomi,5fmlaf,1480467807,I have no one,No one who is in my corner to help me. I currently live alone and I know if I commit myself my nparents are going to want to dictate the care I get and I don't want them to at all. They will want the docs to medicate the hell out of me and make me compliant with their demands. They don't give two shits about me. All they give a damn about is how much it will cost and cheap out. I have no one I should just end it before they destroy my sense of self well what little I have at any rate
Needsun91,5e9d1y,1479797305,Completely ashamed of myself to the point that I WANT to die (long),"Hello  I am here to say that I'm completely embarrassed of myself, to the point where  suicide is beginning to sound very appealing. 

Basically, I suffer from a trifold of personal issues that have severely impacted my success going forward in life, and im embarrassed to admit it. 

Basically, I'm 25 and still pretty much am dependent on my parents for money.., they help me pay my rent, to an old woman, a family friend, because I don't have anyone else to live with.... because I don't have any frinds my age really, and haven't really, since high school,  which was over eight years ago, with the exception of my cousin, who I only get to see every two or three months.  Other than that I have no social  life to speak of, amd haven't, all of this time.  So while  everyone else was off going to college and going to parties and all of that jazz, I pretty much abandoned the opportunity to partake in this, because my social anxiety towards the end of high school  was so bad that I literally stopped going to class, amd soon refused to wake up in the morning altogether.  Soon, I found myself sleeping all day long to avoid life. My parents got concerned and sent me to thist all girls boarding  school when I was 18 to try to fix this issue.  
This didn't fix it however.  I stopped going to school in the first place because I was having serious social issues. I couldn't look people in the eye and never had anything to say and it got so bad that at one point one day I literally hid alk day long in the girl's  bathroom until school ended .  I'm telling this story because it should give you an understanding for how heightened my social anxiety and genuine social seclusion was. So I went to this boarding school, and needless to say the social issues ththat i came with didn't go away.  I was forced to be  in close quarters with other girls all day long, with ample opportunities for friendship, but instead I befriended no one .  I hardly spoke a word to any of them, all the while they seemed to be forming close connections, over a 5 or 6 month period.
Anyway, I'm sorry to go on a life story rant but I have to get it out somehow, it's been eating me alive and it's  destroying me.  So after boarding school, I came home feeling just as weird and awkward as I did before... and promptly resumed the same behavior of sleeping all the time.  I didn't want to think about the upcoming future, about being an adult, which I felt unprepared to become.  My parents were frustrated by this and tried to get me help, and even enrolled me in the local college FOR me.  I realize how ridiculous that even is.  Anyway, I went naively forward thinking this would be great for me, because they were enthusiastic that once I got there everything would be magically  fine .  Instead, I got there, enrolled starting in the summer, and was going along fine, got along with roommates and such until fall rolled along, when I was supposed to  be relocated into a new dorm, with a whole new set of people.   I flipped.  I complerely panicked and ended up backsliding because the girl that was assigned as my roommate was way quote cooler than I was, and I had been led to think up until this point that I was nothing but the epitome of awkward and weird and unlikeable, to the point where my mere presence was odious. So what ended up happening.., was that I stopped going to class altogether, amd decided to try to escape this in retrospect silly insignificant situation by moving in with some guy I'd met at the one single party I went to the whole time i was at college and wound up moving in with him almost immediately to try to avoid life.  I wound up making an embarrassment of myself by basically leaching off of him for the next six or seven  months, living at his place free, and pretty much never going outside of it even while he was away at work.  I don't know what I did to pass the time really.  I don't know how he put up with this, or how I let myself stoop to this level of weird, subhuman behavior.  Needless to say, me and this individual broke up, amd my mom ended up moving me out of his place after she found out about my academic probation.  They tried moving me back home for a while.   I then was supposed to go back to community college, which I have been going to on and off for the last SEVEN years, in between bouts of wanting to give up completely  and also periodically skipping classes and failing classes due to lack of attendance due to persisting social anxiety.
In the meantime, I've had several,  okay, quite a few different jobs in different businesses, almost all of which I've ended up quitting because I'm pathetic, amd always fail at getting to know people, amd now legitmately have reason to be morbidly terrified  of letting them get to know me, because on top of all of this, all I seem to capable of in my spare time is obsessing about what a horrific  mess I am, rather  than taking an interest in anything else.... so I have virtually zero hobbies outide of talking about my issues,which makes the whole talking to people thin general I'm so afraid of all the harder. 
Anyways, I have a lot more to talk about, but this is getting way too long.  Basically, I keep fucking myself over due to extreme shyness and not being able to assert myself, and have for years, and have wound up at twenty five years old and washed up, uneducated  and very inexperienced in life and probably socially clueless adult who has no friends, no real experiences to talk about to try to make friends, no interests, and so on, amd I'm morbidly terrified of letting go anyone get to know me cuz theres nothing TO know. so the prospect  of getting a job and fixing my money issues and social issues are looking slimmer and glimmer. I've even been considering  trying to work from home as an option, that is how stuck in feel and afraid I feel of changing this lifestyle.  
I now don't know what to do because I am getting older every year and still haven't been ab,e to get a  grip, and it's getting harder to hide from relatives.   The last four or more years have been so painfully awkwars at Christmas and the such, having to try to explain why I don't have a career, only a job here and there, why i still don't have a man in my life when all, the other cousins my age do have these things...and so on.   The longer I let myself be this isolated, I fear the harder it's going to get for me to integrate myself into society.  Shit, it's already hard amd incredibly embarrassing and terrifying, and why I am stallingoing on making any improvements.  
What, people, should I honestly do to get over this? Should I just accept that possible embarrassment is inevitable and somehow grow comfortable with the fact that I'll always feel like a socially awkward duck, or do I honestly own up to how I've lived my life even if it's been embarrassing this far, and even though this might alienate me from people? It hurts knowing that it's true that I haven't lived a normal or socially acceptable life,  amd I don't want to become any more of a pariah than I've already turned myself into.  Seriously though, how does somebody recover from this? Is there any hope, or should I really just go put a gun to my Head? I'm willing to do it and I'm getting ready.  It certainly doesn't help that there's a guy whose actually interested in me that I only met due to a random fluke due to my one and only friend something about me when she was at a bar and he has no idea who I actually am.  It gets kinda awkwars pretending to have a life when you don't  actually have one.  Anyways what the hell do I do, how do I turn around during nearly a lifetime of social isolation and indecency and Quickly? If I can't get a relatively quick turn around in a relatively short amount of time,  and I'm talking about couple months at most, I'm going to do it, I'm going to commit suicide.  I just can't stand this eery pathetic lonervous anymore, I hate feeling like I'll only live to be judged harshly by other people."

awaythisthrow123,5b3miv,1478267162,What is the meaning,"Okay. This might be the wrong place to post this, so report this if it is.

I have a friend, that has been suicidal, and through helping her through these difficult ages has been mentally taxing on myself. It was during a dark period for me also, and because of this, I too fell victim to the feeling of a situation of helplessness and worthlessness. It was an unhealthy cycle. I thought I was able to help her, pull her out, but then I realised I wasn't a professionally trained psychologist/counsellor. Looking back, I realised It was wrong, in feeling like it was my duty to pull her out of this, when it was never my right to do so. I felt used in a sense, how she would come to me when she would need it, then disregard me and stop contacting me. I wanted to help, but I couldn't at the same time. I understand that though, it is her right and decision to do what she pleases. (However I never had anything against her coming to me. It was her life assumably on the line which was important, so I always set aside time for it)

Fast forward to recent events. She makes frequent blogs to help her cope with suicide, and shares them on Facebook. This frequently involves encouraging blog posts about suicide: such as ""I want to live."" or ""Coping with suicide."" with a couple of messages encouraging other suicidal people (which I am extremely thankful for): racking in countless amount of support and love on Facebook. With the many people aware and provide attention she now gains from these blogs, I'm incredibly blown away.

Today, we had a conference and at the end is reflection/sharing time where you can take the mic and share about spiritual growth. She walked up, announced to a large crowd she was suicidal and considered attempting suicide: and continued sharing about the spiritual growth she was able to gain. I was proud of her to have the strength and bravery to speak up to a large crowd, as some she didn't know personally. However Reddit, I want to know your thoughts on what had occurred. Is there ever a line between how many people are aware on your mental illness? Or would you keep it on the down low and a small tight circle for people you trust? Just curious.

I have decided to step back and stop contacting her. She should be able to have support and people to talk to her now.

What are your thoughts on extremely vocal people on social media such as Facebook and extremely public spaces about their mental illness, such as suicide/anxiety/depression? In a sense I found it incredibly encouraging and comforting to read, but later they repetitively show up over and over. Talking about the pain she endures (in a sense can be a coping mechanism) is wonderful, however you begin to notice a trend that continues. I just hope it's all for the better."
Seemslikeenough,5ahlpm,1477980509,Let's talk STD's,"I caught herpes. I have had relationships since, but I don't want to ever discuss this in person with someone ever again, so I'm no longer dating. I've used a few hookers, but, really, who am I kidding? There's no reason to live. I will only ever be able to give someone I love herpes, and I'd rather just not. Too far gone seems like a reasonable feeling to have when you have an incurable STD. Before my diagnosis I'd always felt that those with a viral infection should kill themselves. So now, it sort of feels like the normal conclusion of that feeling. "
mangostarjelly,5fn6tw,1480474886,HS senior stressed out to this extent,"I honestly feel like a failure. UC applications are due tomorrow, and I submitted yesterday. But I messed up on listing my extracurriculars by saying the word ""I"" in every sentence before actually saying the activity. My grades don't do much for me either. The thing is, I applied to a bunch of colleges, and I feel like absolute crap. Like being compared to others in pools of applicants, feeling dumb and unintelligent, and feeling like I'm going nowhere fast. I just feel like dying; I cry at least nine times a week because I feel like a disservice to my parents and those around me. I just want to end it. Sometimes I picture my own obituary and wonder about the reactions of other people around me. When it gets really bad, I think about self harm--but when I do it, it's not on a large scale, just enough for me to feel something. I feel numbed. At the same time, this whole process of college is taking a toll on my self-esteem that might drive me to suicide, and I can't opt out given the 4k or more my parents have already spent trying to help me succeed even though I'm pretty sure I'll fail.

cattracka,5d2b9q,1479214056,I have no future and it's killing me.,"(First off, I'm using a throwaway account just to keep anyone I know from seeing this.)

For a little background, I'm 26 years old. I graduated college two years ago with a pretty average GPA in International Studies. I wasn't sure what kind of career I wanted, but I knew I wanted to travel the world and figured that might open some doors.


All throughout my life, I've had horrible depression and anxiety, but I managed to push forward by being fairly isolated and taking a lot of online classes. 


I had some part time jobs with minimal social interaction but I've never held a job for more than 6 months. I don't get fired or anything, I usually just panic and bail. Upon graduating, I decided to take a job teaching English in Japan. It was working alright for a while, but the anxiety started taking it's toll. I lost about 40 pounds and got huge, dark circles under my eyes. I started having stomach issues daily (I'll spare you the details, but think ""flu at it's worst"").


Upon coming back to the US, I decided to go to the hospital to get my health checked out and find out what's wrong with my stomach. Over the year, I've had a few minor surgeries until my shitty small town doctors finally admitted that whatever I have is beyond their knowledge and they referred me to a hospital 3 hours away next month. I will never be able to afford it.


Abruptly coming back to the US, I had no insurance. I hadn't found a job, either. My only choice was to enroll in financial aid at the hospital. The hospital flat out told me that if I had any sort of income I would be dropped from the financial aid entirely, paying everything out of pocket.  So, I haven't worked in a year.
Eventually, they found out that my intestine has deformations along with a bunch of other things. They put me on disability, which isn't much considering I never paid towards social security. It's enough for rent and a little leftover. But I still can't work until this has finished.


And, even if I get out of this, I'm going to have a massive gap on my resume. Not only that, but my company in japan isn't going to give me any sort of good reference after leaving after 6 months. I have a degree, but no experience, no references, and an awful resume that makes it look like I'm 26 and have never held a real job.
In the past year I lost my health, my career, my girlfriend of a few years, and anything I may have had resembling a normal life. I don't really see it getting better either.


I'm in therapy, but it isn't doing anything. Neither are the meds. I don't necessarily want to kill myself, but I don't see any reason going on. There isn't anything there for me. Best case scenario, I'm a lonely bum from now on. I can't even be social. I hate being that one jobless guy of the group... the welfare bum. I'm sure as hell not finding another girl like this either.


I just don't see any future at all. I'm not sure what else to say. "

I'm estranged from my father. All my life I've done nothing but try to get his approval and support, even when he divorced and moved far away from us. Life at home sucks a mean dick. We went from upper middle class to a small income and my mother has no idea how to budget or how to manage finance.
 
We're living with the three of us, mother brother and me, and it's just generally bad. We have really good moments and it feels great but the majority is just really bad. I admit I can get really angry at times. That contributes to it.

zealpeal,5dg17m,1479392530,In a bad place after a breakup,"I've spent the last 3 years with the man of my dreams. Slowly he started gaslighting me and telling me that I'm crazy, that I'm fat, that I wasn't good at racing my bike, that I am lazy, that I shouldn't be around kids. 

He started hitting me. He started telling my sales accounts which he also services for a different company how crazy I am. He cheated on me for the entirety of the 3 years we were together with tinder, craigslist, women from the industry and also just asking anyone out who he thought he could.

At my college graduation he texted me that it was taking too long. He forced me into a threesome he said other wise he would breakup with me. He assaulted me 4 times, 2 of which I called the police for and they didn't believe me because I ""didn't have any marks on me"" 

He was my rock... and it turned abusive so slowly I didn't see it. I've already been divorced and have little family to speak of. I'm an incredibly needy person and feel so alone. The first time I tried to commit suicide was when I found out about him cheating with a race offical. Being in the hospital for 3 days was the worst thing that has ever happened to me.

I'm contemplating but don't have a plan and am not on the edge. I'm terrified of going back to the hospital or saying something to my therapist. My friends are great but it's never enough and I don't want to talk to them about how I feel because nothing anyone says placates me. It's never enough the only thing that soothes me is my ex. 

I picked somethings up from our house today (which he was smart enough to not have in my name as well. I was homeless for a period despite having a well paying job) and even though the police told him not to touch my things he packed everything up to ""help"" he put dirty clothes in my clothing and now i have to wash everything or go to the dry cleaners. and I just can't handle it. I wish I could see my therapist every day but nothing is ever enough I just want to be back with him and everyone tells me I can do better but I know I can't. I figure I'll just live long enough to take him to court over the pictures he posted of me on craigslist casual encounters and just give up."
oliviasea,5bt2if,1478610305,I think it's finally the time.,"I know that posting here is probably a cry for help, probably begging for someone to tell me not to, and I'm honestly not sure if this is some last ditch effort to save myself subconsciously, or a pathetic attempt at some attention by crying out like a child. I honestly hope that I don't get to find out, but I can't figure out another way to put my final thoughts out there without my family ever knowing them. For whatever reason I feel the need to say something, there's an odd pressure I'm feeling right now to end it all on something profound or inventive. Sadly, I have none of those thoughts, there is nothing I want all of you to know about me or why I'm doing this. That might be the reason I'm doing this at all, I suppose, the thought that even in my hopeful final moments, I have nothing to add. Nothing that hasn't been said before, something that hasn't been thought before, and the realization that everything I'm going through has been handled by others, some worse, some better. But here I am, I have one of my favorite cartoons on the tv, and the only thing I can really hope for, is that everyone I know, just forgets about this. Maybe if I'm truly lucky enough, I'll get the most inept Coroner that has ever lived, and they just file this under natural circumstances and no one blames me or themselves for something that was out of all of out control.


I hope I didn't bore anyone, that wasn't my intention. 

Bye, I guess. I don't really know how to end it soooo. yeah. 
Peace and love to the rest of you. "

Last night on FaceTime I had a close friend confess that she was sexually abused at a party and contracted an incurable std from it. She hasn't told anyone else but said she has been feeling worthless and dirty. Wanting to kill herself. She even told me she tried to and took an entire bottle of Tylenol around a month ago. I FaceTimed her until 4 in the morning when she fell asleep at the end of the conversation she said she felt some relief in letting me know what happened. She was afraid to tell me for a long time, she has self esteem issues and tries to act like a partier because she thinks that that's who people think she is. But she is actually very caring. We discussed plans to make things better for the future and ultimately decided that it would be best for her to seek help. I told her I would take her anywhere she needs to go so she isn't afraid. 

She agreed and is feeling slightly better but I don't know where I can take her. I am a male, if that matters. Any thoughts on where to start? Once again I live in Ashtabula county Ohio."

Thank you reddit community (on my main you guys are so nice) but this is my goodbye letter. "
Polsken,5f0anp,1480179003,"I've honestly tried my best, I just don't know what else to do. I have a plan but if it doesn't work I don't have anything else","I love my parents and I know that they've worked very hard in their lives to give me a good life, and I don't blame them for anything. I'm thankful of their support and understand why they made certain decisions, regardless of the outcome. 

I'm a 21 year old male in my 3rd year of an ivy league university. I generally work 2 or 3 jobs at a time to keep myself busy, workout daily, and play different instruments. I have tried to learn as much as possible and follow every hint of passion in order to make something of myself.

I've been a victim of two seperate sexual assaults around the age of 6; one by a man, and one by a woman. In these instances, my biggest regret was never speaking up at the time and having the fear and guilt that because of my inability to act they they could and very well may have went on to hurt other people. Whether or not it's healthy for me to believe that is another topic in itself.

Around the same time I skipped a grade and was bullied severly untill I was kicked out of high school at 18. Growing up I never had any friends and attended 12 different schools because of how I was being treated. Around the time I was 16 I did meet 2 people who I still keep in touch with, however, I don't get to see them very often. I've been assaulted, robbed, and have had a knife and hammer pulled on me without provocation.

My mom has always been supportive of me, and has done her best to help my through the issues I had in school. While my dad was supportive of me as well, he consistently pressured me, hit me as a form of discipline, and used religion to influence my behavior. Both my parents have said something to me at different points that still resonate painfully with me till this day. During a conversation where my dad was telling me how much of a failure I was at everything I was doing at the time, he told me that when he died he didn't want me at his funeral, and I don't think I could ever get over that. I understand what my dad was trying to accomplish by raising me this way but that doesn't change how his actions have affected me. My dad has iterated to me a number of times that the only reason he is still around is because of my mom, and given the chance would have left or kicked me out a long time ago. My brother constantly tried to upset and physically hurt me to the point that I went months at a time without speaking to him. Our relationship is strained and I don't see or speak with him very much anymore. Aside from everything stated above, my parents have worked incredibly hard to give me and my brother a good life where we never had to worry about our finances and always wanted the best for us. Unfortunately, various circumstances led to a different result and by no means do I blame them for it. My dad is essentially a saint, so the fact that he doesn't speak to me anymore and resents me is killing me. If he was an alcoholic or whatever I could brush it off but I would give anything to be half of what he is so for him to have so much against me hurts more than anything else.

Recently, I felt like my depression was getting worse so I began making appointments with the psychiatrist, doctors, and therapist that had knowledge of my history. Even though I took an anti-depressant for a 7 month period, in which 4 of those months I iterated the fact that it stopped working and was affecting me in a debilitating way, my psychiatrist said I wasn't compliant and refuses to see me anymore. The doctor at my school put me on the spot asking me about what traumatic event happened in my past that led to a possibility of PTSD. I said I wasn't comfortable mentioning it because I had to drive home and she kicked me out of her office. The Mental health coordinator apologized for this but the assessment I was suppose to undergo is effectively cancelled and I would be lucky to see another psychiatrist in a year.

Based on the fact that my mental health has never been debilitating for me under stress or in any full time job, and since I'm sober and not using medication, I was looking at enlisting in the military in 2 countries where I have citizenship. My hope is that I could leave home and be on my own, which is my comfort zone, and eventually seek treatment thereafter. The Mental health coordinator agreed with me that this could be beneficial. It's just honestly killed me that the last few people that I could ask for help have effectively told me to fuck off. I don't have anyone else to go to.

I've done my best to test my self, work in as many different industries and positions as possible, as well as constantly learn new skills in the interest of finding something therapeutic or the possibility of developing a career but nothing has truly worked. I feel worn out and honestly don't know what else I can do or use as motivation to keep this up."
nuclear_meltdown,5fpni4,1480513348,My job is going to kill me.,"I hate my job and I feel stuck and every day it makes me want to die. I hate it and I keep doing poorly and I feel like I can't leave because it's the only job I've been able to find that pays so well for the little education and experience I am able to offer.

I have a perfect job ( i am male and work at a nursery), enough money (i can do anything i want), really good friends etc, everything seems so perfect so me but it isnt.

My biggest problem was my weight i was at 140kg without any selfesteem was never into girls. 

I started to work out, lost 40kg and now i am at 100kg my face is nice but my body is still a mess and i try to fix it best as i can. 

I am 25 and just never had a girlfriend and this makes me really sad. Its like something in my life is missing and in cant find my counterpart. If in think about it my thoughts of ending it gets stronger and it makes me more sad. 

If i am at a train station i think , one step and its over, if i drive in a car, just accelerate and turn right then its over

I never had the balls to do it but i was often really close"
icantwth8,5eqlxj,1480030812,I think I'm done. I need advice.,"Not sure if it helps but I'm f, 23. I want to end my ""life.""

1. I have debt from college, I don't want my family being stuck with it.

2. I don't want anyone to know, at least not for a little while. Or, ideally, find me at all. It seems cruel but the few people left in my life know me as the adventuring type... I feel the unknown would be easier on them.

For me personally, it has gotten to a point to where nothing is helping, and I am slowly becoming more and more pitted in this. I have been depressed my whole life, I remember having an interest in suicide when I was younger. Moreso, I found it fascinating and often found myself contemplating, as I feel I had a good understanding of it even at that age. 5 months ago I took a box cutter to my wrist for the first time, didn't tell anyone hoping I would die, just ended up at the hospital anyway because of others, now I have a nasty scar still healing.

I get surged with deep, awful waves, just... waves that flood me. Agony is all I can describe it as, the word seems cliche but fuck, it's just agony... Face hot, throat knotted, chest tight, emotional overload, agony. I've become so apathetic, so cold and every day, all day I feel as thought I am millimeters from crying. I feel all the motions behind my eyes and I have to excuse myself so much (from friends, work, etc) to sob like a little bitch. Almost always (if I am not sleeping or trying to alleviate it with cannabis) I feel myself on the urge of crying, and when I allow myself to, it's so painful and exhausting, usually I fall asleep right after.

I wake up and are exhausted, engaging with people is exhausting... my apartment is... well, hardly one anymore. I can't bring myself to clean, to do anything. I won't go outside at all unless to walk to work. I don't remember to eat, or drink most days. I'm fucking tired. 

I am alone. Not in my depression but in where I am, I have no true friends, no outlets, no family (I only have a mom and some nieces now...) that takes it serious. I no longer show or feel emotion, I'm starting to look a little ill...? It's just... when it becomes a point to where ""it'll get better,"" ""I care about you,"" just makes me feel worse, more alone, stuff like that makes me cringe, and cry. It just upsets me to hear, because I've heard it for so long and it's only gotten worse.

tl;dr... I want to die. Please give me suggestions, or refer me to informative sites. I can handle some pain prior, but want to avoid any sort of possible frightening deaths. So no jumping off buildings, medicine that'll make me seize out, come to, seize out again, etc... Also, the two questions above. 

I've waited, I've hotlined, I've cried for help, I've tried to help myself, I've tried committing myself to old hobbies I used to adore, it doesn't get better. I'm done now, please help me.

Thanks..."
LizzieMills,5cs2kg,1479071179,"61 and so, so tired of trying","I've had hard times since moving to a New England state in 2013 but nothing compares to the last few weeks. Not a day goes by that something doesn't go spectacularly wrong. (Example: I had my roof patched a few weeks ago because I can't afford to get new shingles. The other day, the patch blew off. For the second time.) There's no help for older, disabled people where I live and I'm too tired and too sick (three mini-strokes since June) do to it on my own. I just keep hoping that the next stroke won't be a mini, that it'll take me. "
Jamie59,5cs6pp,1479072467,"It feels like everything's going downhill, fast","It's hard to live when you've never known happiness, but it's even harder when you've known it and also understand it'll never return.

A year and a half ago, I was an incredible naive teenager that somehow managed to stay optimistic in incredibly crappy circumstances. Around that time, I met the girl who afterwards became my first girlfriend at a camp. It was strange; when talking to her as well as others around me, I felt (and probably was) extremely confident, charismatic and healthy whereas I was shy, introverted, and self-conscious before. We only knew each other for several short days, but everything seemed to click perfectly in place. Though our homes were separated by more than a hundred miles we tried long-distance, and everything seemed perfect. Though those days were tough like any other, it always felt like it was worth living, getting through every day to talk to her at the end of it.

a few months later, I attended an internship at a local university and found a passion in physics. I worked feverishly on a research project for two weeks, barely doing anything else. I had hope for the future; I had something I loved enough to make my career, and I had someone who I loved more than anything.

But the good things didn't last. On the last day of summer break, my girlfriend broke up with me suddenly, and vanished. As an instinctive coping mechanism, I became obsessed with making the perfect mask for myself. Though I had managed to fool even myself that I couldn't feel emotional pain, it showed up in other areas. I lost my passion for academia, and a halfhearted attempt at a relationship afterwards showed me that it seemed I had lost the ability to feel happy like I once did. Now, I've been diagnosed with clinical depression and it feels like everything's going downhill.

Every time I try to get myself out of it my head keeps reminding me that I will never be happy like I once was. I fear I've lost the ability to feel happy in the first place. I still can't feel any passion for my major field even though I'm set to go to uni to study it, and I don't think anybody would even want to befriend me much less anything more than that in and after uni. Back then, it felt like every day had a purpose, and was worth living; nowadays it feels the opposite.

Is this really the end for me?"
BipolarAndSuicidal,5chdtc,1478903906,For over a decade I said I'd wait until I'm 30. Today is my 30th birthday,"And quite probably my last.

Everyone has always told me that things will get better. In middle school, things would get better in high school. In high school it was college. Then it was ""the real world"" outside of academia that I should look forward to.

Now I'm sitting alone in my apartment making a fucking peanut butter and jelly sandwich for my birthday dinner, after having been called in to work because other people wanted off for fuck knows why.

I made it to 30. That was my goal. I'm honestly not sure I'll make it a day further."
[deleted],5fl24a,1480451468,Tonight's the night.,"I reach out to family and Im ignored. Ive posted on multiple forums and I'm ignored by strangers. Maybe that's a sign that it's time. I can't keep up and no matter what I post or where I post no one gives a shit. So I'm done. I want to say bye to some people I know, but I don't know what to say. I'm hurt and I'm angry at so many people for noticing yet saying nothing. So no one I know personally can say that they ""didn't know"" or ""didn't expect this"". I read an article and it said that 90% (or something like that) of people who commit suicide leave something behind that hinted that they were going to kill themselves. I can't count how many times I've made it obvious to everyone I know that I would eventually kill myself. No one gave a shit then and they won't now. I can't make people care about me, they choose not to. So I give up. I'm hanging myself tonight in the bathroom, I would do it in my room but my door has no lock. I hope everyone else on here feels better soon.

nininininithrowaway,5fluaj,1480459383,What do you do when you just don't want to put in the effort anymore ...,"This is going to be entirely a stream of consciousness, so I preemptively apologize if there are any grammar or spelling mistakes. I don't want to proof read this, I don't want to check each itsy bitsy word like this is some essay I need to turn in and make sure it's perfect, I just want to huddle up in this corner with my phone and stay here.

I feel so unhappy and unfulfilled. That's it I guess ... There have been times in the recent past where in the moment, I think I feel some form of happiness. There have been times in the rushing heat of the moment where I think to myself, ""so this is why my life is worth fighting for."" But at the end of each and every day, I end up going to sleep feeling ... like there is something missing. It's as if each and every part of your life were divided into pieces of a puzzle and all carefully formulated and placed together ... yet as the time I have ticks by - as the days I have fade away - these pieces are slowly taken away, broken, disintegrated and forgotten. Sure, I can try to appreciate the pieces that I have for now ... I'm so thankful for those things ... yet it's still just an incomplete puzzle. There are so many missing puzzle pieces. So many missing; and not enough still with me.

I genuinely try to stay optimistic. That has been my goal in life since my first, (and only) attempt I think ... seven years ago. JEEZ it's been a long time ... cudos to myself for that. Actually ah, let me try to elaborate on my first attempt and what its effects were on me in the last few years.

In 2008/2009, I attempted to kill myself. I blindly in the middle of an overwhelming cloud of depression and anxiety swallowed an entire bottle of my mom's prescription medicine. Ziprasidone I think. I must have been a huge racket in the bathroom because my mom walked in on me maybe five minutes into my struggle to end my pain ... and man ... I friggin love my mom. I see a lot of people on here who don't have a close relationship with their parents and all I can do is offer my deepest and most insincere sorrow. Having someone you can trust as much as a mom who loves you unconditionally is the absolute best.

She caught onto what was happening pretty quickly, and she got me to the hospital pretty quickly ... where my stomach was pumped ... not so quickly. And then I was kept in the hospital because I was in danger of hurting myself ... and that process went by ... not so quickly. But I suppose what happened that day isn't why I started making this vent. What I wanted to get out of this story is that that day was when I realized life is so god damn short. I spent everyday before then only worrying about myself, but really I was a lost cause anyway. Why would I help a being - myself - who had already given up when I knew that I could dedicate my energy in trying to help other people.

... And that's what I did I guess. I hate myself and I think about dying nearly every single day, yet I haven't told a single person that despite how vividly and vicariously these thoughts press against my mind. It takes every once of my effort to push them down and try to stay strong. I have to, there are people who depend on me. I have friends who go to me for their troubles - friends who thank me for everything I've ever done for them. Heck, I helped one of my best friends through a suicidal phase ... hehe ... I remember staying up with them for hours and hours just to keep them company and make sure they were feeling comfortable and ... not unhappy I guess. They thanked me years and years later for all of that - they told me that I was the reason that they were still alive and happy today. 

That comment alone made me feel like my life had value. And I'm sure it does, yet I am blind to that. Maybe that blindness is caused by depression, who knows. I don't have a therapist - or even anyone - I can talk to about these kind of things. It took a ton of effort to make this post because I DON'T want people to know I am depressed.

I want people to think of me as a positive role model that they can look up to. A caring and hardworking child, a loving and supportive friend ...

I just want to help other people because I know how it feels to be so low ...... yet I don't want them to see how low I really feel.

Today was a kinda shitty day. My parents have an absolutely terrible relationship, (they stick together like glue because of religious beliefs) and the moment I got home I had to deal with their petty little arguments over petty little topics that will never matter fucking in the next week. I hate the screaming and the crying, I hate how my dad takes his work related anger out on my mom and I, and I hate everything about being home. I never want to go home after school, I look for every opportunity to stay out and just stay away from all the hostility.

Ueee ... I am so tired. I put in a lot of effort, I think. I have put in a lot of effort in trying to be s good person - trying to do well in school and trying to prepare for the future. But I really don't know if I even want to ... even try anymore.

I don't know, there are a lot of things still that make life worth living for. I have a boyfriend who means the absolute world to me. He listens to me, he helps me out when i'm stressed out, he cares for me and ... god I love him ;_; it would crush him if he saw how I really felt, and it would destroy him if he saw me go in such a terrible way. I can't give up ... for him. Even though I want to so badly.

... This vent feels really nice to write, it's like a lot has lifted from my shoulders. Thanks a lot to whoever is taking the time to read this in its entirety. You're a very good person."

I haven't felt the urge to kill myself, and I don't have a history of self-harm, but recently when I feel down I often think how easy it would be to make it all go away by going to the bathroom and slitting my wrists or walking in front of a bus. I haven't told my therapist because I am afraid what would happen - I know, what might happen if I don't tell someone could be worse. 

An ex who completely abandoned me came back into my life recently, but after a short stint she said that she found someone else with whom she ""sees potential"" and now she is no longer in my life. This, coupled with strained relationships with my family exacerbate things. My overall unhappiness and underlying depression are definitely deeper, stemming possibly from adolescence. My hopelessness is growing and I am getting tired of coping and pretending like I things are okay."
Connorsaurusrek,5f2osa,1480208034,"I have no idea what to do, it seems like the only option","I'm 17 years old, my mother died 9 months ago due to cervical cancer, it didn't affect me much at the time because I was lucky and found the love of my life. I still cried and mourned over my mother but it seemed easier because she was there with me. The next few months were good but unfortunately she was a german exchange student at my school and the time came in June when she had to go home. I was really sad about this another person I loved leaving my life I even had my first time with her. I went over to see her in July and that's probably the last time I was ever truly happy.

Once I went home things in the relationship weren't smooth. I was getting jealous whenever she went out with her friends because I wanted to be her number one priority like she was to me. However she never felt the same she still loved me just obviously not enough to make me a priority in her life. 

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, she told me she wanted to do an aupair ( a year away in another country) and I freaked out because this meant that it would be even longer until we could live together. That was the last straw for her, she broke up with me and it crushed my heart, the next day we FaceTime to talk about it and she was said she didn't want me seeing other girls even though we broke up so she said she would think about another chance, she did this 3 times and both times she decided no more chances she just got my hopes up and then shot me in the back.

When we were together I bought flights for her to come over in December to which now she says she's not coming so that's £96 of my money lost and I come from a poor family so that didn't help.

But now ever since she declined to come over I have just been getting sadder and sadder and I don't know what to do, it's like all my emotions about my mother and my break up have collided, and on top of that things in my friend group isn't going well they all hate me because I talk about being the only not virgin too much, and I agree I do but they made a fake dating profile in my exs name and I lost it at them and that's another reason most of them hate me, they are all at a party tonight with eachother and I just can't handle being alone anymore

I just want to die it would make my shitty life so much easier, the only reason I haven't is because I live in the U.K. And a gun seems to be the most painless option but I can't get one, I just want to die it would make my life so much easier "

Madsadandnumb,5eltav,1479960963,Does this ever work?,"...posting on here, I mean.
Earlier today, I was trying to work through my depression by cooking a few T-day dishes in advance. I barely made it through my second dish. I started with a few tears then, it just kept growing until I was doubled over whaling. I thought if I sat down for a minute, maybe I could get myself together. Get a grip. Get back to the task at hand...
It didn't help. It only made me more comfortable to hold my head and wipe my face, making room for more wetness. Right then, I thought how much I just wanted to die. I have no family, no friends, no children who depend on me.  Then I thought, how?  OD on some meds? Nah. It's not a ""sure thing"" and it's too slow. What about my gun? Could I actually do it? What about all the blood, I don't want to leave a mess for my husband - he faints at the sight. I should do it in the bathtub. Ok yeah.  Then, my phone rings and I'm still crying. I'm still in pain, but I can't answer it bc I can't compose myself! So I scream/yell/cry. The phone stops. I wipe my face. Decide I can't do it.  I can't pull the trigger. But I can't stand this feeling of worthlessness and despair and... just utter pain!
I check to see who called, and it was my husband saying he's on his way home. 
Well, fuk. I have to try to pull it together to call him back. Here it is almost 8 hrs later and I still just feel so stuck. 
Crying, sleeping in a separate room, depressed, and no ideas on how to make my situation any better. 
I'm under 40.  I've been disabled for 3years now and cannot work, can't support myself.  I'm stuck, he's stuck, I have nowhere to turn bc anyone I share my situation with just expresses pity - and that is one of the worst feeling, next tohopelessness and depression. 

So, I ask you - does this group posting ever work? Are there ever any real solutions that come to help someone out of this dark place?"

I have next to nothing motivation. I don't know why I do some of the shit that I do.

8-BitMitchell,5c6akc,1478757040,Just one of those days.,"Holy shit I never thought I would post here myself, but here we go. I have these intense mood swings, one day I feel I can conquer the world. Planning ambitions to make my own company and be successful in life. Today though, I am feeling crushed by sadness, it has been happening slot lately. I am a 23 year old college art student (great life choices) and I just feel like I have so much on my plate that it might just be easier to take the cowards way out. I think about quite a bit, hell I have even made suicide pacts with myself. I thought things where turning around for me, I was getting into art shows and I have been asked to be a teaching assistant for a grad program. So that was a plus. Then I met this girl who I just fell head over heals with, but I feel I am being led on. She refuses to say we are anything, and she just is memorized by her ex. Of course I am the rebound guy. The thing is, no matter how many people say how great my life and how bright future looks... I just feel so fucking empty all the time. I think about suicide all the time, and I feel like I am being pushed closer everyday. I don't think I have the guts to do it, but it feels like a shadow that is always behind me, whispering insults and depression into my ear. Christ, I am spilling my guts on r/SW. I'm not sure if I can pull myself out of this.

Edit: Forgot to add I try to fight this creeping darkness by making jokes. Just laugh it off, but even now that is failing me. "
pretttyvisitors,5auug0,1478148222,a memoir of my life,"Im not holding anything back in this post, if i work up the courage tonight(which being the coward i am in probably wont) this will be it. Im 16 years old, im a female, im 5'2, weigh 113 pounds and im mexican american. I have anxiety and depression from sexual, emotional and physical abuse from when i was young and because of fucking school. Ive always hated everything about myself, i wrote my first suicide note on the mirror of the 2 bedroom  apartment me and my family lived in with my moms lipstick when i was around 8. I dont remember exactly what i wrote, but it was pleading god to send me to heaven and to make my family to care enough to bury me. My mom was cooking, my dad was at work and my siblings were with my cousins. I sat in front of the mirror, starring at my reflection for what seemed like an hour but was probably 10 minutes. I was crying at how ugly and worthless i was. After those minutes, i got up and wiped the note off with a sock and left to play tag. I have always been a coward. 8 years later and im still here, but i dont know why. Today i have 3 friends, but our friendships are nothing special. They tell me everything about their lives and i listen, but the second i try to open up about something from mine, they play the ""whose got it worse"" game and start telling me of stuff theyve heard on the news. I have never had a boyfriend, i understand why though, im fucking repulsive. Everytime i look in the mirror i feel such disgust, I dont beliieve there will ever be a day were im actually content. My mom is fucking beautiful, which is why shes constantly cheating on my father and introducing me to her weekly boyfriends. People look at me, then at her and laugh. I think i look like my dad. I loathe in self pity. School is fuckign insane. I go to a highly competitive high school and have low grades. Everyone has everything together, except me, the stereotypical mexican. My teachers tell me to get my grades up, but when i ask for help tell me ive missed my chance or that i should of asked before. This is all my fucking life. There is nothing left thats worth going on for. Im a waste of space, I just want to die already."
[deleted],5d2hhe,1479216430,It's not going to stop,"And no one's going to help. I've told my family I'm suicidal and I've asked them for help getting out of this situation (finally) but the next day they just pretend like nothing happened. I don't see how I can consider them moral when they're just leaving me to die. I helped them when they were falling apart and they've never done the same for me. I want them to push me, like they should've done when I was little.

Add the fact that I was apparently the butt of a big humiliating joke and seriously what reason do I have to live? I'm a late-20's male ffs. These thoughts are just fucking tragic.

I don't want this anymore. People are so petty and egotistical.  I tried to avoid everyone and I got very hurt when I letsomeone in that I thought was different. I don't think this world wants people like me anymore. And I don't think I want to live ina world that's so cold and unemotional. A world in which peoplewill destroy an already suffering person out of pure malice and pathological jealousy. 

I'm upset because all I need is for people to fucking listen, but the world has become such a selfish fucking place that I know that's not going to happen. I feel better after visiting my therapist but it's usually gone by the next day.

Thinking about killing myself is the only thing that brings me peace. I wanna do it. It would all end. No more waking up suicidal. No more crying. No more pain. Maybe I would even get to transcend my human form and go somewhere better afterwards. I found a knife that's sharp enough. A bunch of whiskey, a few slashes and it's over.
"
[deleted],5ar2yb,1478106048,I'll never be happy. I can't go on with this pain,"I don't know how to start this... or what to say.

I feel like no-one can help me. I have a psychologist and have been attending for several months. They said they cannot help me and they can't do anything. I feel trapped.

I hate myself. I have cried so much over the past few years. I feel absolutely worthless. I feel like everyone hates me. I've been bullied at school for 9 years and it progressively got worse... it was because I was gay. I've been beaten, inappropriately touched , threatened to be killed and people constantly shouting vile things to me about it...

I only really figured out I was gay near the end of last year... I even have a boyfriend now. He is the only thing that kept me going but... I no longer have any strength

My mother knows about my mental illness and mocks me for it. She'll shout at me every day. She has gone away for a month now.. I should feel relieved. She would call me worthless and tell me about how I have ruined her life and the rest of it and I cause all my problems and I enjoy the sympathy and attention seeking.

I feel so unappreciative ...   nowadays the bullying isn't as bad, although I've never had friends in the past now I have my boyfriend to rely on, and my mother is away. I'll never be happy...

I've called many hotlines to talk things over. I feel like I really can't be helped... I feel terrible for thinking this with my boyfriend , wanting to throw everything away. But the pain.. it is too much and I don't have the strength to hold on anymore.

It all gets me down... everyday I feel depressed. The doctors have diagnosed me with Clinical depression , Anxiety and eating disorder... it all haunts me everyday. My mother mocks me for it and tells me to man up about it all. 

I hate eating. I cry every time I eat now... I've actually ate the past few days but I wish I had the strength not to ... because it upset me more and i hate my weight.

I want to get rid of this pain... this pain I've felt for years. These years i've never truly been happy. I feel like I can't be happy.. i really can't. Neither of my parents want me , I am a mistake and my Father disowned  and my mother will repeatedly tell me how she hates me and I'm different to my siblings.

I never know what to do... if there was a button that I could press to go , i would have pressed it. I've walked on the streets at 3am in the middle of the road and no cars ever came. I can't bring myself to kill myself... I recently moved but previously I had a plan and that can't be executed here.

My boyfriend lives far away... he is so supportive. I can't believe I'm at this point. But i can't be saved... there is no helping me. I'm even seeing him tomorrow... which i thought would never happen as my mother told me about all the shame and guilt i'm bringing to the family by being gay and how I have betrayed the whole family.

I don't want to get any older. I can't deal with it . My mother tells me i'll fail at school because of the way i am, i'm trying hard to hang in there but i hate myself. Everyday is a battle with myself to keep going... 

Why am I even posting here ? I don't know. I've felt so bad... I record many things in my journal. I can't stay here... this is all too much. I don't know how to hold on anymore. I've tried being strong for years but this pain is just not worth it. I want to be free of it ... I want to be dead. "

throwaway939348320,5d8438,1479283513,I need someone to talk to,"I've been off and on depressed for a few years now, I really don't want to go into the rollercoaster of my feelings in the past, but more so what I feel right now.


I have 2 years left of college left (currently my 4th year) and I detest it so much in my college town. I have no friends(I haven't had friends in all my time here), I'm not into the party scene, and I've been alone for longer than I can remember.


Anyways, I'm getting the fuck out of this place after this semester. I can't live here by myself any longer. I'm joining the air force. And I'm looking forward to that, and all of the benefits I can reap.


However, I haven't told my parents and they are going to flip shit so hard. I've had such an enormous amount of pressure put on me to get my degree. Everytime I've talked to them during a break over my college career since I switched majors has been ""when are you graduating?"" or ""how many more years?"". Everytime I bring up depression (only 3 times I think) they dismiss, or say ""it'll all be worth it in the end"". It's... not a good indicator that they care about my feelings tbh.


I can't please them and I don't want to, but they've also supported me a lot (maybe 25kish throughout my college career). I can repay them, but they are going to resent me and I'm not sure I'm going to be able to handle it.


I still have an apartment that they cosigned for and I'm still looking for a sublessor. I can work after this semester and pay my rent and stuff so it's not too big a deal. But moving my stuff back into the house when I go to basic is going to be awkward af.


Anyways, I feel awful and I know once they found that I'm dropping out they're going to hate me. And don't say, ""Oh they won't hate you"" you don't know my parents. They flip their shit on every fucking decision I make for myself. When I decided to go to CC for a year after switching majors, I got viscous texts. When I decided to go to Japan by myself last summer with my money, they were vehemently against it for no good reason and very mad even though they both traveled abroad by when they were younger. (My mother lived in Texas and went to Mexico by herself as well.)


You know what's the dumbest fucking reason for staying alive that I have? I worked last summer and went to Japan and bought a decent amount of manga (mostly moe) and I've been learning Japanese so I can read it all. I don't want to die b/c I don't want someone to go through it after I die nor do I want to waste it and throw it away. How pathetic of me, right?


I'd imagine that the consensus for people offering light support on this sub is that suicide is selfish. But aside from suicide, have I been selfish? I've asked for advice once before about joining the dropping out and joining the air force, (leaving out the depression) but people said to tough it out and finish, but that's not possible. I can't stand this place any longer. I've put up with it for too fucking long. I can repay my parents with my air force salary and I will be provided food and housing. I'm 22 and I can still change paths a handful of times I feel like.

soskin_,5brjk1,1478583917,Saying goodbye,"Hey buds, not trying to pull off a naval on this post but, here it goes. I've had suicidal thought for the passed 7 months. And the last 4 months I've hit rock bottom. Back in August. I wrote a passage saying I had a loaded gun to my side and ready to fire, seconds later. I pulled the trigger and my mindless body feel to the group thinking I was finally gone, done from this world, no more caring, no more thinking. But no. I pulled the trigger but the gun didn't go off.... I went into a mental hospital for about 3 weeks. I bullshitted that so much so they would just get me out. After I got out of hospital I wanted to commit suicide again, got some chlorine  tablets and hydrochloric acid. I was huffing and puffing away until my mom found my half alive in the floor. Hence again. Got put back into another hospital. How fun right? I was in their for a little more then a week. Got my new meds.


Now that I'm passed do and I've done as much as I can, I want to die and actually be successful. My pass two where just a whole waste of time 

I've got a lot of meds saved up just for this one boys.

-Pristiq 30(25mg) 30(100mg) 
-lexapro 30(10mg) 30(20mg)
-lamictal 90(100mg)
-Xanax 30(2mg)

Also got some Ambien to top it all off, got about 15-20 pills of those. And going to have a few nice cold beers on the side, I can't wait. Shhh don't tell my parents. I'm only 18

I blame myself that I didn't stop it, and I feel like I deserved it because bad things don't happen to good people.  I genuinely feel like I don't deserve to live and I'm in too much psychological pain to function.  When I tell my therapist, I'll probably get sent back to the hospital.  I used to hate the idea but now I just don't care.

Kenadamsss,5bgari,1478446854,I can't handle taking care of my suicidal friend anymore.,"Hello,

Recently I've been going through some tough times. I'm going to school and it's my last year before I graduate. Lately I've been really depressed and anti social. Refusing to talk to most people because I get anxious and I start to cry. I can handle going got class, but I haven't gone out to eat with friends in over two months. I also hate sleeping anywhere other than my room. And it take a lot of effort on my behave to even go out to eat McDonald's if I don't absolutely need to. So I wouldn't say I have the healthiest mental state right now.

Now my friend is also going through depression. She was hurt by someone and that caused her to think that people don't care about her and that no one is there for her. Even though it's not true. She has plenty of friends, but she refuses to accept them as ""true"" friends. I've been helping her deal with these issues for over 2 and a half years.

Before I got in my rough times, she would go out drinking and partying, but then in the middle of the night she would either call me or show up at my place drunk. This isn't wasn't a once in a month thing, she would do this Like twice a month, but I might be over exaggerating, I can't remember for sure. Sometimes things would get really bad and she would threaten to kill herself, saying she didn't want to live. And one several occasions I had to spend the entire night with her taking away razors from her or broken glass and pills. When I take things away she would hit me, punch me, slap me, and one time even attempted to cut me (I think this was accidental). I've also called 9-11 on her, because she told me she took pills and I didn't know what else to do. either way all of these events have caused me to start resenting her. She's a dear friend to me and I've tried to help, but it's just too much for one person. I can't handle this anymore, but I want to help.

Before I got my depression I could handle it, maybe. I was at my limit. Now that I have my own problems I'm still trying to take care of her, but I desperately need my alone time. I only go out to eat with her when she asks, I go and stay at her place to watch movies, even though internally I'm terrified and uncomfortable to sleep anywhere outside of my room. I'm usually sad, when I spend time with her. But I make an effort to try to take care of her. Lately I've spent 7 nights over at her place and only about 5 nights alone. In the span of two weeks

She's in a constant spiral of negativity. She says she hates her friends, but doesn't do anything to make new friends or distance herself from them. she says there are a lot of problems, but does nothing to fix them and just puts the blame on others. 

Lately I cry any time she gets upset at me and she says that what I'm doing now isn't enough for her. She says I don't try enough, but I do. It's just really really hard for me to socialize with other people right now, because of what I went through. I really only talk to her at this point. She also says she wants to be more than good friends, which I do not want. I want to be alone and I don't want to be in a relationship, I also don't think I can mentally handle taking care of her anymore. 

Also when I get really depressed I try to stay away from people and just keep to myself because I don't want to cause people trouble. She's repeatedly told me that she can't handle taking care of me, and that it's exhausting for her. Even though I never call her in the middle of the night crying and asking for help. And I'm also only been like this for 2 months ish. While I've taken care of her for much longer and never complained. I think she says she can't handle taking care of me because when I get depressed I refuse to spend time with her.

I want to run away. I want to lock myself in my room. What can I do? I don't want to just leave her, because if I do I'm sure she will feel alone and kill herself, but I also can't handle it anymore. I'm getting to the point were I cry every time she tells me she's going out to drink, because I hate how she gets when she drinks. I also don't want to be in a relationship. How can I tell her that without her feeling unwanted and suicidal? 

Tl;dr: I can't handle taking care of my self destructive friend, anymore. Need advice on how to help her. She also wants to be in a relationship with me, which I do not want, but I don't know how to say no without her being suicidal.

Thank you for the help."

valerie_6966,5buoae,1478627045,What do you do when,"You don't enjoy anything anymore ? 

I actually hate most things. And most people irritate or annoy me when they talk to me. I hate that I feel this way, but I can't help it. I just find absolutely no value in anything anyone says ever.

All my hobbies.. All my work. I just can't help but feel I'm so average or below average at everything I do. It's so demotivating. I want to try new things sometimes, but when I can't figure it out or be decent at within an hour I get so frustrated. I just want to quit everything immediately. It's never ever fun. I don't find anything fun anymore.  

I've been fantasizing about dying every day. My favorite way to do it is to cut my arteries. I feel like I can already embody exactly how that would feel. And it's so enticing. Idk why. I hate feeling this way. I feel so gross. 

I don't enjoy anything anymore. Not food. Not video games. Not work. Not my apartment. Not long drives. Not music.  Not bike rides. Not running. Not drinking. Not smoking. Not sleeping. Not staying awake. Not sex. Not abstaining from sex. Not showers. Not anything. 

I want just ONE thing. Just one fucking thing. But I have nothing. 

It's so hard not to give up. The only thing keeping me here is the burden of knowing the pain I'll leave on my friends and family. That's my core. At the foundation of my being, is that understanding of how that feels. And if that leaves me? It's over. I'm thankful my pain hasn't penetrated that core inside of me.

I just don't know how much longer it will be before that too is gone. And I'm scared it's not long at all. "
LilDelfino,5amjo4,1478042987,I'm ending it in less than a week.,"I want to end things Saturday night, once I've fulfilled all my social obligations for the weekend.

Feelings of loneliness and self-loathing have gotten to a really bad point and I feel like it's my only option. I've tried being a good person and to be kind to others, thinking it will make me feel better. Unfortunately it doesn't. No matter what I've done or who I help out, I will never see myself as good. I will never feel like I did good enough in school or in life. To put it simply, I absolutely hate myself and I think other people dislike me as well. 

The only thing I see in the cards for me is a future of scrambling to build my reputation in the corporate world, living alone in an apartment with very little sleep and company/friends. This idea scares the living shit out of me and I am less than 2 years away from this reality.

The only thing keeping me somewhat in check is going to the gym and video games, but those are giving back diminishing returns now. 

I'm going to write some letters to friends, family, etc to explain that it isn't their fault. Hopefully this won't be too big of a hassle for my roommates, I'm pretty replaceable.

Had to get this off my chest before actually doing anything, so thanks for reading. 

P.S. I wish you all the best in the fight with your own personal demons, there are many of you who are strong, even if you don't know it."
Wagjaffer,5ew4gx,1480111929,I can't imagine a future where I don't kill myself,I don't have anything to live for anymore. I just want it to all stop. Nobody loves me.
grandiosit-y,5fl7az,1480452928,When should you go to the hospital for suicidal ideation?,"Sorry for any typos. I'm on mobile and not feeling well and in class.

This is the worst my mental health has been in my life. Nearly every day I want to die. I don't see a hopeful future for myself. If some little problem happens I immediately want to kill myself.

The thing is, I dont have a specific plan. I've thought of ways that I would go about it and what I would do before it but there is nothing set in stone. 

I am also too scared to go through with it. But I often want to. But I know I won't. I don't know if I will one day.

I'm tired of feeling like this. I'm so tired of not being normal.
I have social anxiety and OCD. I dont have any diagnosis for mood disorders. I have symptoms for a lot but I'm not going to self diagnose because I hate that. It's ny fault I feel like this anyway. I don't make efforts to make myself feel better and when I was 14 I started being ""depressed on purpose"" because I thought that was the cool thing to do like a fucking idiot. So I don't even feel like any of this is valid. How do I know it's real or if I just put myself in this situation and I can feel better any time if I just try? I've tried thinking positive but it's pointless to me. But I don't know if that's me just subconsciously trying to be depressed to be cool still. This isnt cool though. Im a psych student so this is gonna sound stupid but I dont even have a reason to be sad. I know that's not how this works but in my case only this is how I feel.

Would anyone even take me seriously? I'm so scared. I can't do it anytime soon anyway because I have exams (both suicide and voluntary commitment). Also it's almost Christmas. I don't want to ruin it for everyone.

My mom would hate me. Im an adult and dont live anywhere near her but she would hate me. I dont want her to make me live with her again either if I go for ""protection"". I live with my brother and SIL now and I know they wouldnt force me to but I'm scared.

If I go, when do I even go? How do I do it? Im embarrassed to tell my brother how I feel. I was thinking I'd just go when they were at work one day and message them. But I feel like that's an asshole move. 

None of my friends would care. The ones who would wouldnt be able to visit. I know I would just feel wprse and like my life didnt matter.

Im 19. I live in Toronto. Im not going to therapy even though my school offers it and that's my fault but I can't give enough of a shit about myself to make the appointment.

If I go I dont want my family to talk to me about it. theyll never treat me the same. its embarrassing i dont want them to know how i feel
"
sillyredalien,5fm5vq,1480462936,Trapped in my head,"I need to get this off my head, just don't want to feel so alone.

I hate being conscious and try to sleep as much as I can.

I can't let go of the problems that bug me all day. I can't feel happiness, just dread and anxiety.

I don't enjoy life and would prefer to not be here. Just like I was before being born.

Both of my parents told me they were suicidal in the last year. And it is very hard to handle. I feel like I've mourned my dads death even though he is still here. I feel so alone in the world and afraid of the future. 

Money is very tight and I am stuck in a dead end job. I can barely save money each month. I have no financial support.

My friends aren't really there for me. I don't trust them.

I ruin relationships. I broke up with someone cause I felt like they didn't like me back as much and not very affectionate. I then slept with someone else and realised we aren't very similar. Now I regret breaking up. And it's painful.

I ruined the new relationship cause I don't really want kids and that bothered her. She went all weird on me. But I've only known her a week. I'd prefer if it didn't end awkwardly.

I have nothing really worth living for and if I had access to a gun I think I would pull the trigger. There's really no way to do it painlessly.

Sorry to be a bummer but I'm going through a lot in my head at the moment."
willDIEsooon,5fsafj,1480541087,Couldn't get help.,"No one wants to help I tried helping myself but nothing works. What suicide methods do you recommend? I don't care how painful it is I obviously handle pain well, I want to know which one guarantees success. You can inbox me too. Thanks."
chaosconsumeus,5fsndi,1480544571,rot without end,"Before I start I would like to apologize for any mistakes in this message since I am not a native speaker. I also might swear a bit, but bear with my sorry ass.
More to the point: I want to kill myself, mainly because I am exclusively sexually interested in little girls and am a pedo. I've been conscious about it for a while now, around 4 years, and it's been getting progressively worse. It's an incredibly shitty condition to live with, and it comes with a myriad of moral problems and dilemmas of its own, such as any kind of relationship (if it can even fucking be called that) being inherently and potentially dangerous and damaging, me growing steadily older and so on, I'm sure any person would be able to come up with a gorillion of reasons what's so wrong about it. Needless to say, I would never hurt an object of my deranged attraction, so I'm bound to having to spend the rest of my days in solitude, and I'll tell you what, it gets you. It gets under your skin and makes it crawl. Like, every time I see a cute girl on the streets or in public transport, I'll instantly get overwhelmed with a complex rush of emotions, a rather contaminated mixture that includes rapture, panic/anxiety, hunger, sickness, despair followed by an intense desire to just fucking end it once and for all. 
I feel incredibly forlorn, I really do. 
All of this has been just slowly incapacitating my ability to function on a basic human level, I just see no point if I'll have to act as a stub of an actual human being till the end of my days. What makes it even worse is that I have incredible, loving parents that has done everything to fulfill the needs and secure the future of their genetic failure.
I assume someone is going to recommend going to a therapist, but I don't see that option as a feasible or reasonable one since I live in a 2nd world shithole of a country, so I'm afraid that's out of the question. And I don't have funds to go abroad either.
I'm honestly pretty much convinced that I'm doomed, but I'd like to at least last long enough so that my parents won't have to endure through struggles of losing their child, they've done nothing to deserve that.

I'm just a teenager with teenager problems (having trouble finding a job, a family that doesn't like me, etc). But I've done a lot of thinking. So maybe I'm less like a suicide victim, but more like a suicide... advocate? I don't know. I mean I still tried, but that's not the point.

Just think about it this way: There are some things in life that are absolute, and I use these to further my viewpoint that life only gets worse. As you grow older, you're only have less time and energy, and more responsibilities.

What's the point of living when you know that life only gets worse? At least when you die, you don't have to deal with any of that. But the fact that we try to live anyways just to try to not hurt anyone just shows that we only deal with how much life sucks just to try to please people.

Perhaps many of the other reasons I'd want to go out are out of young naivete. I'm not even 25 years old yet, so I've still very little of the world experienced. For example, one of these comes with the fear of having to have two jobs just to make enough money to make a living. Even if that doesn't sound too bad to you (the reader), my first (and only) job was such an insufferable mess that only flooded me with millennial ""anxiety"", I just can't imagine having two soul-sucking things like that. 

Still, even if issues like that were to disappear, I still don't see the point in living a life that only gradually degrades. And I've yet to see anyone who can convince me otherwise. Yes, ""b-but l-life has u-ups and d-downs!"" Yeah, but it's still going down and down in the end.

I use to spend my teenage years helping teens recover from attempts at suicide, loss of loved ones, addictions and more. I was confident in my ability to read and assess almost anyone and handle any situation. My helpfulness these days has long since been gone. I'm expendable living off of others and others merely using me with me being the person holding them back. I can't even trust my own wife, the love of my life. She leaves for days or even a week or two at a time to spend time with ""family"" that almost always are males that she has to be alone with.. Not to mention that she seems to live many lives with many different personalities. Compulsively lying and believing its even true herself. I have no future I've been failing at trying to get enrolled in college for 3 years straight now. I make a measly sum of money that isn't even enough to support my needs never mind take care of me and my disabled wife.. I have no people skills and I've grown more and more to hate society and people in general over the years. It use to be that I just wanted to run away from it all and live as a hermit supporting myself with as little to no interaction with others as possible.

Meditation doesn't help anymore and neither does drinking smoking or anything else they now only intensify my anguish and emotional distress. I've never had anyone I could depend on or trust except myself and I can't even trust myself anymore. I don't want to die and I don't want to give up, but I keep feeling a dark sense that something is coming and its always getting closer, as it does I lose all ability to make decisions. I'm always having visions. Visions of me with my gun.. I hear and feel the thump of the gas piston as its loaded with the safety off. As I think about pulling the trigger I snap out of it and go into a meltdown full of fear and panic...  I see myself sometimes laying there while I sleep, and I'm in the same position as Kurt Cobain... Ironic since I happen to have the same model of the gun he used...  "

Nobody dies of old age when all they feel, 24/7 is envy, and jealousy, and love, and lust, and sadness.
Some people say that you can't love more than one person. That's a fucking lie. At least in my case. God I wish that were true. I love Naomi. I do. But I love Nicole. And Georgie. And Elly. And annoyingly enough, still Katie. And every time these people leave my life, or I have to leave them for whatever reason, I fall apart. Things just get worse and worse. When you so suddenly go from seeing a person every single day, to never seeing them again, how do you cope with that? Am I too loving? Or clingy? Am I pathetic?
Yep. 

I'm a 24 year old, straight, white, male, in a society telling me that I have it better than fucking anyone, but constantly feel ashamed of my thoughts and feelings. I constantly feel pushed aside. 

I got demoted at work last week. The only people who know yet are my bosses. I haven't told my girlfriend. I haven't told my parents, or my (now) fellow employees. I used to be respected, and I don't want to lose that. I got demoted. That hurts. That's my boss telling me that unused to be better at my job. That's my boss telling me that I'm going downhill. Who goes downhill at 24? I peaked already. I've already felt all the best feelings that I'm ever going to feel. Do I have 50-70 years of going downhill to look forward to now? Why the Fuck would anybody want to experience that? 

I have a rope. 
I bought it to use for a fun night with a girl once. Now she's in love with my brother. Does it not seem fitting that something used for such fun, could go downhill with me? It used to be a fun rope. I used to be a happy person. 

My work uniform is in the washing machine. But I don't know if I can go in and spend more time with people who like me less than they used to. I was gonna go to work tonight and help make someone better than me some more money. But instead I'm going to relieve myself of all of this bullshit. Who needs it? 

I love too much. I care too much. That's gotta be it. I won't let people's names, because then there will be the argument of ""why was she listed before me???"" or whatever selfish thoughts y'all can come up with. But to those who know I love them, I assure you I do.

[deleted],5es2l6,1480053250,My boyfriend tried to kill himself today and I don't know what to do.,"We've been dating for about seven months. I've always known he had fairly severe depression and anxiety, but he goes to see a therapist and takes a lot of meds, so most of the time he manages to get by. 

The past week and a half he's been in Canada visiting friends, and everything seemed relatively okay. This afternoon he texted me saying he found out he'd failed maths at uni (which means he has to repeat the subject next year), and then suddenly he said he's done with life and everyone and everything. Then he logged off messenger and stopped replying to any of my texts or calls. 

I freaked out. I spent two hours texting his friends to try to find out where he was (he's staying in a hotel). I had a couple of panic attacks and cried more than I have in ages, leaving him probably dozens of voice messages and texts and calling him every few minutes. 

Finally his friends said he'd been found (probably by the hotel staff) and is now in hospital. His mum is flying to be with him tomorrow. 

I'm just so in shock. The amount of relief I felt when I found out he wasn't dead was so strong, but in its wake I think I might be in shock. I feel so numb, I have no appetite, everything around me is moving strangely, I feel like I might collapse any moment. Above all else I'm just so glad that he survived, but I have no idea how to deal with this. What to say to him after, how to look after myself, how to recover from the love of my life being so close to dying. I don't know what to do. "

Throwavvayaxxount,5d7zmn,1479281176,This is a first,"So reddit this I'm having a very low low of depression and thought the internet might be a good place to ask for help and advice so I don't end up killing myself sometime this week. A little backstory on why my depression has reached all time lows

I've been dating the same girl and let's just say her name is G. So G and I have been dating since my junior year of high school and she was a sophomore at the time and we were all fine. Our relationship was blissful and full of love and joy and happiness right from the start then I went to college but in the same city so we still saw each other all the time but when she went to college she went across country. We have been together for almost 3 years with not a single argument or fight and everything was going well or so I thought 

Come mid October we have a massive fight and she ends up telling me she wants a break and needs to think things through so I give her time despite the fact that I was a fucking wreck the first week and it hurt everyday and push me into a pretty dark depression but the thought of rekindling with her kept my spirits kinda up or up enough to not do anything permanent. Now fast forward to today she tells me that she wants to end it right now until she can come home in a month or so and we can talk and see if we want to continue

I asked why and the more confused I was and asked questions the angrier she got. I asked if we are over for good then and if we'll talk abouti t when she got home because I was genuinely confused she then yelled at me and said if I ask again it will be a definite no and said she doesn't want to let go of 3 years of dating but wants to let go of feelings of hurt that she has from me but she can't let them go if I keep contacting her. I see this as a cheap cop out basically saying I can't get over you if you keep talking to me not this we'll get back together if you leave me be bs she's spewing. 

Anyway so I want to believe that she wants to still be together but needs time to herself but so here comes my problem. I love this women more then life itself and she's been the center of my world for the last few years and we've even discussed marriage and moving in together and I was gonna move cross country for her and to have it all possibly ripped away has put me back into a extremely severe depression and I honestly want to just end it because I don't see a light at the end of this tunnel. Any advice would be nice because I definitely need some right now. 

TL:DR- almost perfect 3 year relationship crumbled apart. Says she wants to get back together but needs to let go of hurt feelings. I don't believe it and want to kill myself because I have nothing left to live for

Tariq2222,5e0to7,1479684013,Homicidal Thoughts,"This is scaring the shit out of me.

I think I've genuinely gone insane.  After 2 years of having thoughts of self-harm and killing myself, the anger is beginning to stem off and I feel an incredible sense of hatred towards people.

I just want someone willing to listen.  Everyone I know left me.  Either ignoring me or letting me know I was unwanted.

I was in the process of seeking professional help multiple times but it never resolved.  I feel like even those in the medical sector don't give a shit about me.

The thought of ending my life now seems like a logical decision because I'm afraid of what I'll do if I don't."

pleasehelp2838,5baj9u,1478361174,I know I need help but I know trying to get it will only make things worse. I'm running out of options.,"throwaway because my bf stalks my account

I'm honestly at my wits end. I know I need help because I think of suicide daily and I desperately want things to get better because I am so tired of this. I'm scared to die but I hurt so much. I'm so fucking alone.

Pretty much the only people are talk to are my mom and my boyfriend. They're the only people that even associate with me anymore. I know they get frustrated with me and I try so hard to stay on their good side but I know they'll both get fed up and eventually leave like everyone else.

I went to a hospital in feb of last year and it really helped. The hospital part. But coming home from that was the worst time of my life and I'm scared of it happening again.

My dad's side of the family has a history of suicide and they don't respond to the concept well. I know it's just because my dad gets scared that he lashes out but he gets mean when I have tried to talk about it before.

I've known I needed help since I was 16 and when I first tried to tell him about it he told me if I did he would piss and shit on my grave and that he would hate me forever. When I attempted last year, my college made me contact him and twisted my arm to get me to voluntarily go (basically the ER said I could go voluntarily or they would petition me to go unvoluntarily) and he blew up. The whole time I kept saying please don't make me tell him, you don't understand how he'll get, and they wouldn't listen. When I showed the counselor the texts he sent right after she said ""wow I'm sorry I didn't believe you, I never thought he would be that cruel"". The fall out from being committed was that my dad gave me an ultimatum of dropping out of college because I ""couldn't handle it"" or he would cut me off financially and emotionally for good. 

Now I'm living with my dad's mom. I know I could talk to my boyfriend or mom about but they would force me to go to a hospital and I'm on my dad's insurance and my grandmother would tell him if I'm gone for a while.

I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like all I can do is shout to the void on the internet and it makes me feel so small. 

I'm so close to giving up

lalathrowaway99,5f8eb6,1480290663,Should I go to the hospital (x-post from /r/depression),"I've been seeing a therapist for a while about my anxiety and depression. She knows that I occasionally have suicidal ideation/thoughts of dying on a pretty predictable schedule.
I recently told her about some thoughts I was having before. Feelings of hopelessness and helpnessness, that I was am a failure and useless and that the only option was to kill myself. I mentioned visualizing how I would do it.


She recommended that if I begin having thoughts like that again I should at check myself into an inpatient mental health facility, or at least go to the hospital. We've begun discussing possible places to go and how to deal with telling friends/family members and missing work.


I am unsure if I should really go though. I am afraid the suicidal thoughts are going to pop up again... I know they will, they always do and it is hard not to despair. In those moments I really do feel like I should be somewhere until I am stabilized and possibly put on meds. But I also know deep down I am not going to kill myself, and these feelings always pass with time.


I'm just not really sure if my symptoms are severe enough to warrant inpatient treatment. I have an appointment for an evaluation with a psychologist in a couple of weeks, and feel I would at least like to wait until then and see what she has to say before committing myself to hospitalization.
I don't know what to do. Sometimes I feel like I can handle it out here in the real world and that I am committed to getting better, but sometimes I feel like it's too much and I need to be somewhere away from it all for a while."
frozen_shut,5cah0h,1478813199,I just don't know where to go anymore.,"I'm so fucking tired of everything that is part of my life. More and more I keep succumbing to insanity and hopelessness. I recover, because I'm mentally strong. But I always return to this dreadful state. The time between being happy and unimaginably sad becomes shorter every time. My mental strength is fading. My bucket of hope is down to its last few drops. 

There is too much going on in my life and I can't take it on alone anymore. That is the problem. I've always been practically on my own. Left to my own self. In my entire 26 years of living I've never met anyone that I could really connect with. And If I did make any friends that I could connect with, the friendship would somehow water down over time. 

I'm not sure where I'm going with this post. I'm so confused and plagued by all kinds of thoughts and worry that I can't write a coherent post anymore. Almost everything I try to undertake ends in either mediocrity or failure. I work so damn hard to make something of my life but every time life turns around the corner to kick me in the balls and crush my face into the ground. 

I'm not a real man. In my 26 years of living no woman has ever been interested in me. I can't see why since I'm not ugly or have a bad personality that I know of. Yet apparently nobody wants me. There is just something about me that turns women off. That's the conclusion I'm coming to. Never kissed a woman, been loved by one, never hugged or had deep conversations about life. Never made love. And yes I've date people and such, I'm not the kind of guy you think I am. I don't live under a rock or anything. Not that it would matter. I see all kinds of people ending up in relationships. Only I don't. 

I only have a few friends. One hand is more than enough to count them on. I know quite a lot of people and have a decent social life, but I just always feel like there is a glass wall between me and everyone else. Every time I put myself in a vulnerable position, I get hurt.  

I'm truly tired of life. I truly am. I don't know where to turn to anymore. I don't know what to hope for anymore. Hope for me, has always turned out to be a thing that only enhances my inevitable pain. And I just want the pain to stop.

I've come to despise the happy careless people that act like life is some sort of party and everything is fantastic. They seem to have everything worked out, but didn't have to do very much for it.  People like that have just been dealt good cards and don't know about the true world that surrounds them. Reality is a very cold and heartless place to be in for some people. I've stopped talking about my problems to a certain person from my family I trust a lot. I don't want to bother anyone with my problems anymore. 

I just want to be loved by someone for who I am. That, I've learned, is not a possibility. I don't know how or why, but I seem to be broken and unattractive.

Fuck life."

Every now and then I kinda start to feel depressed again, but it usually disappears after a good nightrest. One thing I do still strugle with is a weird kind of being suicidal, which I guess you could call ""suicide curious"", just like being bi-curious.

It's not like I want to die all the time, but almost every day I think about suicide. Like 'what if I just killed myself right now?' And then, 'What would my familly think?' And my friends and fellow students?' I know they would probably be very sad and stuff, but still I'm kinda curious. 'Would they be surpised? Would they ask themselves why they didn't notice it? Would they ask themselves why they didn't do anything to prevent it?""

It's not like I actually have any reason to do it. My life is pretty good I'd say. Got a nice amount of really good friends, my parents love me and I do pretty well in college. I'm not necessarily looking for death, yet I wouldn't mind if I would just die right now.  

This probably sounds really lame and may be kinda incomprehensble, but I just don't know how to express the way I feel about it. Also you might even think I'm mocking people that really are suicidal, but I'm not, it'snot meant like that.

tomkris2,5brb3r,1478580627,Today I imagined how I will commit a suicide on New Year night,"My life may look perfect to you. I'm 30 years old, working in tech industry in top tier company with good salary, recently was promoted. I know that I can find new better job in a day if I want to. Recently I bought an expensive condo in downtown and have enough savings to solve not-anticipated financial problems.

I am living in foreign country, all my relatives are thousands miles away. I have only one friend and never had a girlfriend. The loneliness destroyed me mentally from inside over last year.

I'm suffering from a deep depression and derealization, receiving treatment for last 4 months. Was working with 2 different psychiatrists, tried bunch of different medications without any signs of improvement.

I had suicidal thoughts for a while but they seemed to be manageable and did not bother me a lot. It was rather a curiosity.

Couple of weeks ago I told my friend as a joke that if nothing changes in 2 months (by New Year), I’ll have to figure out something, meaning maybe moving to other country (but internally I also thought about suicide).

Tonight I was feeling significantly worse than ever and I figured that I won’t get better by the NY, and thought about how I will end it. In my imagination I went upstairs to the rooftop, stepped over the rail, thought about what I’m doing, spread hands like a bird, closed my eyes and stepped forward… I imagined that a few seconds I’ll be falling down and then everything will end. I reviewed this situation ever and ever again, thought about when I should do it so nobody can see me, what happens if someone will try to stop me….

It felt so real and scary. I got tachycardia, feeling of lump in my throat, had trouble breathing.

DonJayTrump,5c0uxt,1478695305,Beginning to give up on my girlfriend,"My girlfriend and I (24 m) have been together for a little over a year. A little over three years ago, she (21 f) was horribly raped by her boyfriend at the time. She suffers from PTSD (diagnosed) as a result, and she's attempted suicide several times. She uses a certain painless method that requires a certain item. On some occasions, she's told me to remove the item from the trunk of her car and get rid of it for her. Recently, I found the item in the trunk of her car again. I tried to get rid of it, but she found out and made me put it back. Earlier in the relationship, I would have refused, but I'm so exhausted. I've spent so much energy trying to get her not to commit suicide, but each time it seems more hopeless. And I'm so worried that eventually I'm just going to be okay with that. It's beginning to feel more and more like she just needs to get it over with. She's in so much pain from flashbacks, physical memories, and panic attacks on an almost daily basis.

We spent months and thousands of dollars seeing a couple psychologists and trying EMDR therapy, but she did not respond favorably to it. Like I said, it just feels sometimes like the end of the line. It feels like I'm just buying time each time I convince her that the joy of life outweighs the pain of her mental disorder. I don't want to give up on her, but it's so exhausting and I can feel myself beginning to get mentally fatigued to the point of accepting that suicide is an option for her.

Please understand that I've never loved anyone as much as I love her, which is part of why it's so concerning that I'm seeing suicide as a viable option for her."

The only reason I can bring myself to type this is I still have this stupid notion that somehow it will get better. It never has, but somehow I keep thinking it will. I am just a disappointment to both my parents, an embarrassment to my friends, and a footnote in other people's lives. As it should be. 

I get to watch classmates with bright futures and loving friends off themselves (someone who had SO MUCH going for him, and yet he still fucking killed himself), and here I sit trying to convince my sorry ass that I am worth keeping around for another day. Shame to my faith, shame to my family, a disappointment to my mentors. 

Why do I even bother holding out for some chance it will get better when deep down I have already subconsciously given up. Why do I fool myself into thinking anything I do will make a goddamn bit of difference in this world? What's the point of all this 'talent' if I can't do ANYTHING WITH IT?

FJrZ,5fdq9l,1480362077,Psychiatric Appointment and Left Feeling Shit,"So I've been in contact with the mental health services for a couple of years now. I've been on anti-depressants for about 4 years. I have been in contact with some mental health units now due to psychosis, and I believe I have psychotic depression, given that I have insight into my symptoms. Basically, I hear voices and have paranoid thoughts, and it is debilitating. I have constant suicidal thoughts, and have attempted to kill myself three times before, due to a mixture of psychosis and severe depression.

I went to see a psychiatrist today (after receiving an initial assessment about 2 months ago, and the initial assessment went really well and was with a sympathetic and understanding nurse). This appointment was shit though. The psychiatrist was condescending, trivialised my problems when I opened up, and showed a complete lack of understanding of my symptoms. I felt as if he didn't believe what I am experiencing, and thought I was just making all this shit up. He said that I don't seem like someone who is severely depressed and experienced psychotic symptoms, and he constantly implied that he didn't believe me, although he said he had to believe me, which was just a professional position for him to take. 

The mental health unit has shit reviews from all the patients who have stayed there, and they are complaining about how they felt undervalued and ignored, and I can completely understand why now.

He reluctantly diagnosed me with substance-induced psychosis, which makes very little sense as I developed these symptoms long before I started drinking, but I know he still didn't really believe me. I need to get some blood tests, and then he said he's referring me to a psychosis team, although ""they may not take me."" 

Now if I don't get help for this, it will end up in suicide. I just know it. That's why I'm so desperate to get help, and I hope they do accept the referral, and the people there will actually understand my condition.  

Sorry to vent. I was hopeful before this appointment, but now I'm feeling bleak and suicidal.

First time was because of my alcoholic mother, in a drunken fit of rage, kicked me out because I wanted to hang out with a friend. The second time was because I walked in on my ex boyfriend screwing my best friend, and he kicked me out so she could move in. The third time, my landlord hasn't been paying the mortgage, and so the building is being foreclosed. I can't afford another place with the little income I have, and there's nowhere else for me to go. I have cuts and scars all over my arms, and I just want to end it tonight. Nobody even cares anymore, and all I get for my problems when I need help is ""That sucks. Good luck bruh"". 
I can't do it anymore. I just can't. The only person I really have left is my boyfriend, and I'm thinking about breaking up with him because nobody wants to date a hobo. That would be painful and embarrassing for him. I don't want him dating a depressed psycho like me either with nothing going for her.

I've dropped out of college because I couldn't take it, and I still do not have a job even after searching. I don't feel like my life will amount to anything at this point but bringing down others. And no friends (not that I really have any) nor my father would miss me once I was gone.

Hold me. Don't apologise. This was never your fault.

I told you about the time I sunk to the deep end of the pool.

I was eight. With only my family in the swimming hall.

No one believed I was drowning.

I told you how my mother pulled me up

I coughed and spluttered, vomiting water

Well I think Hades let one slip that evening and Thanatos is still bitter about it.

Or is it a coincidence I became like this immediately after that swim?

I jumped right back in, and have not strayed far from water in the fifteen years that have passed.

I long for it. I long to be comforted by it. Please, rock me gently back and forth, just like the ocean would.

I always meant it when I said I never felt more at peace than when I stared at the distorted swimming hall ceiling.

The sparkling reflected fluorescence.

Felt the sterile taste of bleach.

This was always meant to happen. This was never your fault.

Have the pools of death cooled my body yet?

Don't let me out of your embrace.

I need you to know, and please remember

You did everything you could, and you made me happy.

For as long as I could be.

The water is calling me.

Rock me gently and you'll bring me there.

The water is calling me.

It soothes me. I will stay afloat here until it's your turn.

I can't wait to see you dive from the tallest platform.

I know you'll show off, you always do.

It's getting dark now. Thanatos is coming.

Tell my mother I'll be waiting for her. Tell my father I wish we had talked more.

The water is calling me now. It's time to dive in.

Please, always remember.

throwaway30930293092,5d067m,1479177880,Useless suffering,"I can't handle this shit anymore. I just had another benzo-fueled night out and even though I was surrounded by people who care about me and understand, I had to play Mr Happy Guy just as always to avoid ruining everybody's fun. I have had pretty heavy social anxiety for quite some time now; I've spent long long days locked away from the outside world, ignoring my friends' invites or lying to avoid social interaction. It has costed me many friends, but this all changed when I moved out (at least so I thought). I made countless friends and actually managed to keep them up until now (I moved out and met most of them in August), but that feedback loop of loneliness is starting to kick in again. I refused four or five invitations this weekend only, because my anxiety kicked in again and I prefered to be alone. I slept for 18 hours yesterday, woke up for five or so hours and went to sleep again. I'm skipping classes and work meetings, using my work as an excuse at college and vice versa. A few weeks ago, I met two very lovely girls who happen to share my struggle with social anxiety (I saw they were outcasts at social events and I used be like that too and I know how shitty it feels, so I decided to approach them). One of them opened up to me entirely, told me her whole story, yet I was too cowardly to open up back to her; I just gave her what I thought she wanted (""oh yeah, I'm awkward too hehe, I get meds for that hehe"") instead of telling her how much I'm suffering right now because of (most likely bipolar) depression, my shitty physical health, my at best disappointing results at college and work and my benzo+weed addiction. I'm somehow managing the latter, but the former is only getting deeper. I had my script doubled since June and it looks like it'll be going up again. I take those fuckers daily, sometimes twice or thrice daily, more often than not running out before refill day and having to resort to dealers. About two weeks ago, I started getting sweet dreams about getting high on opiates almost daily, despite having very, VERY limited experience with them (3-4x tramadol a year ago, 7/10 experience, 5-6x codeine more than half a year ago, 5/10 tops). Those dreams are so vivid and satisfying that I'm actually getting cravings for strong painkillers without even ever having touched them. I am fucking doomed, I'll either stay a benzo-fueled Mr Happy Guy and never accomplish anything meaningful except for ever-deepening insomnia and fried GABA receptors, most likely ending up killing myself anyways or become an opioid addict and die of OD in a few weeks because of my love for benzos. I do want to die, but I don't want to commit suicide; I know too many people would be hurt by this selfish act: my parents who most likely know about my benzo addiction but continue to support me no matter how badly I disappoint them, my friends who try their best to keep me happy and actually listen to me, my ex who still loves me and wanted to get back together many times after 2 years (I refused because she also has her own problems and I'd only drag her down like I did during our relationship) and the rest of my family, especially my grandma who did all she could to give me a happy childhood despite my disability. I really miss my granddad, he taught me all ins and outs of geography and biology, despite me being no older than 8 back then and him being a bedbound and blind long-time depression sufferer. I wish he could give me some strength to carry on, I'm really lacking it and I'm really afraid I'll do something stupid, I had three serious suicide attempts and a bunch of near-attempts. I don't want to suffer anymore, but I definitely don't want to cause the many people who care about me to suffer either. People who barely know me mostly think I'm an outgoing party animal, as I use up all of my energy to socialise in outbursts and just lock myself in my room or abuse drugs for the rest of the time, the girls I mentioned earlier thought I was the most outgoing one of the group and had a hard time believing I have social anxiety until they saw me on an ""awkward"" day, off my anti-anxiety meds. I fucking hate my life, I'm on a crossroad between being more and more addicted to benzos and becoming addicted to all kinds of other shit. I can barely keep friendships for longer than 3 months because of all the above and despite being so ""outgoing"", I go fucking nuts whenever a girl gives me attention. I used to behave like a typical psycho ""nice guy"", i.e. desire their undivided attention and stalk them if I didn't get it, nowadays I just numb those twisted thoughts with drugs and manage to get one night stands with ease, but I'm still inherently incapable of forming a lasting friendship, let alone a relationship. I wish I could die in an accident or of natural causes to stop this suffering and avoid giving my loved ones unnecessary grief and disbelief. I wrote this to vent off, everybody thinks I'm a happy and succesful guy, some might know I'm anxious but still think I'm living a great life, but nobody knows how much I'm suffering. Nobody wants to know."

I can't keep going on with attacks like this either. She is done seeing him, I think I dont really know. I dont really want to know, I just know I want her in my life."

I'm dead inside 
I'm useless 
I don't really know where to start so I'm just going to say some of the things that heavily encourage my suicidal thoughts.
I met a girl 2 years ago (A)
I really liked her within the first 2 months and the crush grew bigger but she fucked around with my heart for a while, we continued to be good friends. Fast forward to August 2015 
I met a girl and I immediately fell in love with her and of course A came back begging for me back and when I wouldn't budge she attempted to make me feel worthless and she did me and this girl were doing really good coming up on our one year 
She comes back 2 weeks before our 1 year and manipulated me and lied to me and convinced me my girlfriend was abusive and shady and a bad person and fucked with my head because she knew how hard I originally fell for her (A) 
Me and A got together eventually like she wanted 
Then she cheated on me, twice. Told me she wasn't sure if she wanted me anymore broke up with me got back left me abused me mentally. She used me 
That was late August to mid September
It makes me want to die 
How could I be so pathetic and useless to her if Im not 
I want to die for what I did to my now ex girlfriend 
I feel horrible and she'll never truly know how sorry I am 
I deserve death

BornOn8thOfJuly,5faepw,1480317830,I'm starting to feel like I can't keep living and being unloved,"I'm twenty six years old. I've never been in a long term relationship. I've never really been kissed. I'm still a virgin. Whenever I have had feelings for someone, and I've told them, it has completely blown up in my face. Part of this is because of mental illness. I have bipolar disorder, which I was only diagnosed with when I was 23. 

After finally getting my moods under control with medication, and lots and lots of counseling, I thought I was over that hump. That finally I was able to love properly and be loved. In the three years since I've been diagnosed, there hasn't ever really been anyone that I was romantically interested in. 

I did meet someone. It is my best friend, and I posted in r/relationships for some advice. But what is scary about it is that all these bad feelings and self-destructive habits have come back. My love for her has consumed my life. I get anxious and panic attacks all the time about her and relationships (example: someone I worked with said the word ""sex"" with no context to either of us and it gave me a panic attack). Last week I cut myself. It is clear then that I shouldn't be optimistic about this relationship working out.

And that makes me really pessimistic about the future. Turning twenty six and still being alone was hard. I just can't see anything ever changing for me. And that really upsets me. It is making me question if I really want to go on, or if I really can go on after this ends.

I've just been in a really bad place the past couple of weeks, and it is a really self-destructive feedback loop. I'm head over heels for this person, and it is bringing up these bad feelings and habits. Therefore, it means I'm not in the right place to be in a relationship (or so my friends say, and seems to be the common opinion). That means I can't be in a relationship with her, and it makes things worse.

The thing is, with all the work I have done I genuinely thought, and still do believe, that I've repaired most of the insecurities I have. I mean, I do get down on myself sometimes about how I look and my weight, but I don't really think about that ever. I feel like I am a good person at heart and like able. So when people tell me I need to love myself first before someone else can love me, I mean, I do love myself! I really don't know what else there is I can do.

And I'm not in the headspace where I can accept there will be other people after this girl that I like now. But it isn't so much about just her. I'm not suicidal because things may not work out with her. I'm not even suicidal really to begin with. I just think about it, and don't know how much longer I can go on.

I feel really unloved and want to be close to someone. Right now it is this person. I just want to be with her, and hold her hand, run up to her and kiss her. Lay in bed together and just be in the moment. 

I feel like a humongous piece of my life is missing and I can't reconcile going on without it."
soundeaf,5esi6p,1480060723,really need someone to talk to.,"this series of events has made me want to blow my brains out several times, but tonight i think its really gonna happen.

The story is ridiculous and cliche, which makes it hurt a billion times more.
it starts with this guy i met last year, which was my freshman year in high school. he's incredible. hilarious, nice, down-to-earth. he likes things i like, even the obscure things that i didnt think anyone really knew about. we have such a synced sense of humour that anything and everything is funny for a good reason. i fell head over heels for this guy. remember, im a freshman and he is a junior at this point.

the school year flies by, and we spend all our free time playing video games and joking around. my feelings for him are being magnified with each second im talking to him. this is the first time ive ever experienced a real ""crush"" before as i prefer to distance myself from everyone. I have no clue how to handle it, so i get a friend to tell him how i feel for me.

he plays it off the way you'd expect him to. sort of a ""i really am flattered and extremely happy but id just like to be friends"" approach. this sucks for a while, but i eventually forget about it and focus on just being a good friend.

school starts back up again, and now im a sophomore and he's a senior. we have our first 2 periods together in a graphic design class (a topic which we both share strong interest in), meaning we get to bond over computers and the internet for 2 hours every morning, 5 days a week. needless to say, i ended up falling for him. again.

i think, ""hey, if i just keep occupying myself, I'll forget about it, like i did last time. no biggie.""

then he gets a boyfriend. in a different state. and gets into a college there. and he tells me about how excited he is to graduate early and go live with his new lover. 

this, of course, hit me like a bus. ""what? boyfriend? graduate early? move to denver? but... what about me?"" i bottle all those thoughts up, though, and just go back to joking with him every morning and creating an even stronger bond.

then, just recently, tons of shit has happened to him. his car got in 2 accidents, 1 of which i was there for, meaning we have to go to court and I'll have to testify for him. he will probably lose his car, and due to lack of transportation, his job, meaning if he's gonna leave for denver, he's gonna have to do it **now** while he still has the funds to do so.

he's been so stressed and emotional and just out of it. seeing him like this makes me want to hang myself with barbed wire, and the worst part is, he doesnt know. he thought i got over my feelings for him. if i told him how i feel, that would just pile on to his ""shit to stress about"" list.

just a few hours ago, he IM'd me, telling me about his emotions and all his struggles. he writes me a proper few paragraphs opening up to me about his feelings. this is the first time he's ever done that to me, so at first, im kind of happy. maybe i do have a chance.

but what does my stupid brain say in response to his cry for help, instead of ""thats awful, here, let me talk you out of suicide""?

**""good for you"".**

of course, he takes this badly. ""Good for me? good for me?!"" 

I try to backtrack with ""I dont know why youre telling me all this! go tell your boyfriend or something."" but then, he goes down the self-pity route. ""Youre right. i dont know why i bothered telling you.""

he sets his status to offline and i try desperately to get ahold of him, but to no avail. i had my chance, my once in a blue moon chance, and i literally just said ""good for you"".

so thats where im at right now.

**tl;dr:** the man ive loved for 2 years unrequitedly finally opens up to me about his depression, giving me a chance to gain his trust, but instead of doing the smart thing and helping him, i tell him ""good for you"". about to jam a hacksaw into my jugular."
AssEatingSlasher,5arr4d,1478112676,Yeah I'm doing this. (Beer fueled stream of consciousness),"I don't know when. Sometime soon maybe. I'm tired of being sad. I'm the saddest one in my friends group. It's almost a recurring joke. Why can't I be normal? I've felt this way since I was a kid. The doctor says it might be dysthimia. I was happy this summer. I was talking to her finally. We were actually dating, after five years of on and off wrong timing, bad timing. Then a few weeks ago it ended. The difference is night and day. It's almost as if the entire Earth dropped 10 degrees once she sent that text. These are all intangible thoughts. Why do I feel the need to have someone. Why do I get upset by being alive. These are just electric impulses in my brain. They may as well not even be real. Why does this cause so much damage. It's all biology. I wish I could just shut down part of my brain that has emotions and just become a non-feeling workaholic. Idk fuck this, Im too drunk to think."
EveylnCaresNot,5ebelk,1479830104,I am tired of living like this,"Me and my family move a lot, she always says this is the last time. I put so much effort into not being alone, into making friends despite how hard that can be. I was diagnosed with major depression in the summer of 2015 but I have suffered with the effects since I was eleven in 2011, I cut myself, burned myself, I took any pill I could find, I drank. I was awful until I turned fourteen, my freshman year was when I pulled myself together. I stopped all harmful behavior except cutting on occasion, I worked hard to make new friends after we moved but I was stressed, stressed of my mother thinking I just need to get over it, stressed with my many siblings, stressed with working so hard. The pain became unbearable so I tried to kill myself once in June of 2015 and again in October of the same year. While in a mental hospital my mother packed the house and prepared us to move to Florida, once there I lived with my grandfather most of the time, I made amazing friends through lots of hard work, I joined a band program, finished a season of marching band. I even went to therapy but my mother said I wasn't trying hard enough in therapy so she stopped taking me, and I stopped taking meds. My mother told me today that we have to move back to Georgia, I have to be alone again, I have to quit indoor percussion, I feel as though I can't do this again I would rather die than feel the pain of loneliness, of saying goodbye, of staring over. I am set to move in December but I'd rather not go through the loss, the loss of the things that helped me get through each day, I am afraid of my mental state, I am frustrated that there is nothing I can do, I am angry that after my mom swore she wouldn't move our schools again she is doing this, I don't want to be alone with my thoughts anymore."

dragen1576,5figmo,1480423939,1 of the reasons i can't be social,"I am going to say sorry, for the use of horrible english in this thread.
Alright this might sound a bit stupidborn ? I just don't get it, and someone might be able to explain it to me, or share their own opinion, or just experience of the situation. Alright so had these 3 friends once, each at different times. The first one, was the first person i ever opened up to. Due to a harsh childhood, with a father with anger problems, which ended up him beating me almost everyday, and a mother who couldn't say no to him, and always being the unwanted child. One day she just abandoned me, without a trace of what i did wrong. Which really destroyed me. From that time i closed myself in from the normal sociaty, because i didn't wanted to get hurt again. After 6 years of me being alone, i finally found someone who i throught, i could open up to. I did and he got down with depression, and quited everything. He left the school, and deleted contacts to everyone. Including me. So again i was hurted, and so on bla bla... Don't want this to be too long. Here this year i found this girl named Julie, which filled all the emptiness inside me but i fucked a little bit up. I was a little to clingy, and confessed my love (yeah i love her and i still do) Too her at a very bad time, and now 1 month and 21 days later (still counting) i still miss her everyday. If she could be here again just as a friend i would be forever gratefull. She doesn't care about me, she has replaced me. So my question to everybody, if you made it through my whining. Is have you experienced anything similar? Because as i mentally stand, i can't open up to people anymore. Before you rant about ""Just because a few things, isn't going your way."" then think about this for a few second. They where the only persons, i trusted without a shadow of a doubt, and they all betrayed me. It may not seem like a big deal for you, but for me it certainly is.

I also have this childhood friend called, Astrid (Which i fucking adore i love that girl) but i don't know if i can trust her, enough to tell her all this. I'm scared she is going to leave me too.
She has her own problems, and her own life. I dont want to ruin it with my life problems, just because i can't be happy doesnt mean i should drag others down with me."
MadDad76,5dfxn9,1479391326,Talked a suicidal friend into calling their local crisis relief hotlines. I'm still worried because of a message they sent afterwards.,"It was after battling with trying to understand their pain. They had told me about self harm and depression but left a lot of specifics out so I was stuck with no info on how to help... This person is super dear to me and I was a bit panicked, so I was watching every single word I said. Eventually I gave them the number and told them it's their choice even after they said they weren't interested in calling. Then, all of a sudden...

""Okay, I'll call. Goodnight. I'll be safe. Thanks.""

It's just... So succinct. Out of nowhere. Something to stop me from worrying. And this person is very, very stubborn about their suicidal tendencies (their words, not mine.) So I'm scared. They could have planned something before going to bed and that message was to keep me from further action. Or am I paranoid?

What should I do now? Keep in mind that they are very long distance so physical contact isn't possible. I don't have their roommate's information. I only have their name and general location."
throwmymentalhealth,5b6x5t,1478301351,Suicide rant,"Something that has been boiling over with my family finally let loose today. (Too long. Story for another day.) When it happened, I felt dead inside. All I thought about on the way home was crashing my car.. I wanted to be dead. I wanted to cut my wrists, feel physical pain, and just ... die. 

I have not felt that way in almost 15 years. 

I don't want to die now... but I am so hurt. I'm so empty inside. :("

Activated_Raviolis,5f0bel,1480179272,I'm tired of being tired.,"I'm 21 years old and I've struggled with severe depression for over half of my life. I dont remember what its like living a life without depression. At this point, this illness has become a part of me and I dont know what i would do if it was gone.

If Im happy, its only a distraction from my depression which is always there. Happiness isnt permanent, but my depression sure is. I'm tired of waiting for the moments in between everything where I can finally feel like a ""regular person"". I don't function the way I'm supposed to. Whatever feelings of motivation and drive for life that everyone else has is something that i lack. 

My friends and family simply go silent when I try to reach out to them. They talk about how they'll be there for me when I'm down, but the moment I try to ask for help they go cold. My boyfriend was the only person who would actually try to help me when I reached out to him, but he broke up with me out of the blue today. 

I'm making plans for everything right now, because being alive and waiting around for distractions is simply too much anymore. I can only go for so long before something's gotta give, and I'm simply at my breaking point. The love i used to feel for people is starting to turn into contempt and hatred. I have nothing left to give to the world.

I initially was going to wait until i had the basis for some of my stories written down so that someone else can take over for me when I go. They were the only thing i felt a passion for, but im starting to feel like it wont matter if they die with me or not, considering theyre something that no one cared about anyways. Plus, i dont want to trouble anyone anymore than i already have.

im currently out of state on vacation and all i want to do besides dying is to get back home. i hate being here and i miss my bed so badly. "
bluevelvetxo,5f0fej,1480180606,pathetic mixed race with parents that hate me,"Hello. My n-parents hate me. My mother hates me because I don't look like her (She's chinese and I just look like a fucking white girl). My father is an Asian fetish, conspiracy theorist, gambling addict, chronically unemployed LOSER who would beat me and tell me how worthless I am on the reg. My mom has hurt me far more, though. She regularly asserts her supremacy and perfection and tells me all the time how I am just a clone of my loser ass father, no matter what I do.

I am a very good person. I have done everything. I attend a top graduate school on full scholarship, have an impressive job lined up after graduation, go to therapy and psychiatry. I have cats and many dear friends who love me very much. I am beautiful and have good fashion sense/decent makeup skills. I have had many boyfriends. I conquered heroin addiction and live a life of sobriety. I eat well and cook, read books, run 5ks at impressive speeds, am funny, have an active social life, speak four languages, good taste in music and movies. I live on my own and pay for all my bills in New York City. I have done everything yet there is a never ending hole in my heart from how my parents have abused me and don't love me. There is a hole in my heart how NOBODY, NOBODY IN MY ENTIRE FUCKING EXTENDED FAMILY gives a shit about me. Many don't even believe me. Nobody helped me when I was a child. The pain will never end, no matter how much I achieve. No matter what, I am that filthy bastard child undeserving of love because of my face. I just don't understand how I can do so well in the ""outside world"" yet be regarded as the complete scum of the earth by everyone I'm related to. They have their own happy nuclear family but nobody gives a flying fuck about me. I'm a worthless joke and regularly told I should love my parents more. WHY? WHY????

Yes, I am no contact with them, have been for five years, until I made the hideous mistake of briefly getting back in touch this summer.

I have extremely intense mood swings and was triggered by something earlier this week. When I'm in these dark places, all I want to do is kill myself. All I can hear is my nmom telling me how I'm such a disgrace and worthless and nobody really loves me. All I can think about is how my mother decided to stop loving me, and how broken and unlovable I am because my own parents hate me. All the love in the world cannot repair this. It's too late. I am damaged. They won. They fucking won. I have ""bad blood"" as my mother calls it, and am broken and cursed. There is no reason to continue living as long as this pain exists. There is no escape. The ghosts follow me everywhere I go.

You see, my mother loved me and was so kind to me until I was about six years old. Being the good natured, loving fool that I am, I thought that I could regain that through all of my material excellence. I invited her back into my life for a mere 4 days and was completely destroyed. I have wanted to kill myself ever since. No matter what hapepns, I am worthless, I am loveless, I am nothing. I am undeserving of a mother's love. I am a freak. I look different from every other half Asian. I am a monster, and my mother knows who I truly am, unlike my friends. I am lucky to have her, because she is tied to me by blood. True quote from the evil bitch herself.
I'm never growing up or getting away from this. The PTSD is killing me. Give me a good reason to not buy a bundle of heroin, snort the entire thing, and make the pain and noise finally fucking stop. Tell me why I shouldn't jump off the George Washington Bridge. I am not going to do it right now, but I feel completely destroyed and loveless. Living in a PTSD hell is no way to exist. I am in so much pain that will never end. I don't want to die but this is no way to live."

5C-53RG4L,5dix26,1479422967,Feeling alone,"Hey everyone. I didn't think I'd be posting here but, well, I'm circling the drain.

My job is one of the only things still keeping me from being a total wreck. I used to work 60 and 70 hour weeks to keep myself busy but I want to have a normal life. I want to be able to go home and have someone else there or a phone call away just to bullshit and spend time with and tell each other how happy we are to know each other. I want someone to love who loves me back. I don't know why I've never been able to get that from anyone outside my family.

Makes me wonder what's so wrong with me. I got bullied a lot in middle school but not by some random kids that didn't like me. I got bullied by kids who were my best friends for years beforehand. Fucked me up bad I guess. I went through high school and college an emotionless shell so I wouldn't get picked on again.

People make me anxious. Sometimes I feel like I'm ready to start 
a fight over some bullshit. I don't want to tell anyone these problems so I keep it to myself and work on them on my own. But the solitude I keep finding myself in buries me with sorrow. I don't know how to deal with being this detached from people, wanting someone romantically close, and simultaneously avoiding lots of people.

Suicide has been tempting me lately. I really don't want to tell anyone about my issues. I want to fix them myself. But this is getting bad.

Thanks for reading this through. I don't even know if it's coherent, sorry if it isn't."

HomemadeSprite,5f9041,1480298050,Feeling lower than I ever have before,"So I've just lost the love of my life, my fiancé and who I thought was my soulmate. I was verbally abusive to her so I deserve to be left. All our friends have seen it and despise me. I grew up in an abusive household, my mother was an alcoholic and my father left when I was 2. 

I was with my fiancé for almost 9 years, and in those 9 years my dad died from a heart attack, my grandpa died from heart failure, and my mom was murdered. Her boyfriend punched her and she had a brain hemmorage, probably worsened due to the alcohol in her system. 

All of this together turned me into a monster with a temper and I used my words to hurt the one person thatoved me in this world, and now she's moving out this month and has told me she has feelings for her best friend. I am absolutely crushed and I just don't want to go on living this failed attempt at a life. I always thought I was a good guy but this time I've realized I'm really a piece of shit. I've never felt this much pain, even when my mom passed away."

I'm tired of bigots, I'm tired of people hating me. 

I don't want to be alone anymore, I feel like nobody loves me at all. Life is so cyclic, and it's becoming painful to get up in the morning. I don't plan on it for much longer. 

I feel like the world hates me and wants me to die, and maybe I will just leave it. It doesn't satisfy me anyways, little to nothing in life pleases me. 

I have maybe 2 or 3 friends, parents, no girlfriend or boyfriend, and nothing else beside that. 

If I die, there will be nobody that misses me. It'll be the typical Facebook posts, ""we should've seen this coming"" mess. 

I don't want to do it, but I do. I'm losing interest in life and the joy of it every day, and I'm considering it more and more. 

I'm sorry. "
goodbyeworldsadface,5e14pm,1479687867,blue bucket of gold,"it's a song by sufjan stevens, my favorite artist. I'll never get to see him live, just like a lot of shit I will never do before I die. in it, he reaches out to all of his friends, begging them to be there for him at a time where he needed it most. he receives nothing. 

looking back at my life, i realize how shitty it has been. being emotionally and physically abused, being very socially anxious, being sexually assaulted by a family relative, having my best friend sister die, having zero friends.. the list goes on. and honestly, im proud to have survived it for years. luckily, all of that has changed! I have a friend, go to therapy, on meds; my life should be good now, right? it isn't. im going to kill myself. considering this, what reason is there to live? if life gets better but I don't, what the hell are you supposed to do? 

I have reached out so much to the hotline, but they were never helpful. i made so many posts here, on r/depression, on other depression forums, rarely receiving responses. even my therapist gave me her number extension to call her if I was ever in a crisis. no answer. i was hospitalized for 3 days, not a soul noticed. i cant describe how much it hurts to be meaningless, even if meaning is just arbitrary.in my opinion, you either live for yourself or you live for others, and you can function with one, but living with neither is truly embarrassing and makes you wonder, ""when did I become so fucking worthless and retarded?"" 

to my parents, friend, therapist, psychiatrist, listen to the end of ""blue bucket of gold"". the part where its just audio and no lyrics. it starts at 2:52. if you want to understand my decision to kill myself, listen to that. 

I have a lot of ideas about life after death, but who fucking cares. i just hope that whatever comes after death is better than this hell. "
SickTiredOverAndDone,5dr48t,1479534111,"When I was a child I told my mom that I don't think I'll ever be 30 years old, and she laughed. Jokes on her though, I think I was right.","Hi all. 22yo female here. I just need to get some things off my chest. Wall of text and non-native English incoming, you have been warned.


I have been depressed since the age of 13. No one believed me. I was a self-harmer, and when they told me I was just doing it for attention, I hid it better. With 17, the first serious suicide attempt, but I failed. 4 months in closed psychiatry. I've been on 8, 9 ? different medications since then, nothing has ever helped. I have a sleep disorder, too - currently its 6am here and I have not been to bed yet. How did my life end up like a pile of shit like this?


My family, oh, I could probably write a whole book about in which ways they fucked me up. My mother, constantly switching between loving and caring in one second and being a cold, manipulative and merciless person in the other. My father, always focused on himself and a hoarder. My brother, choleric and overly aggressive. I love them all, they are good people, but I did not actually need all the therapy I got to see that there was a lot going wrong in my family.


I have had several boyfriends. Every single one broke my heart. Five boyfriends, and five times that I was the one left behind crying. Whether it was cheating, yelling, ghosting, I've covered it all. With my now-boyfriend, everything seemed to go well and now what? He's probably transsexual. He wants to be a woman. And I'm hetero. FUCKING HILARIOUS ISNT IT? I love him to death, and if there was a pill that makes you bisexual i would take it in a heartbeat. but no. unlucky, i guess. 


I was bullied throughout middle and high school. I'm now at college and apart from my bf, I do not have a single friend. Every friend I had vanished from my life in one way or another - ghosting again, coverting to a strict religion, marrying and not anymore being interested in me, you name it. There is about 10 contacts in my phone, which are my family and a few friends of my bf who contact me if they can't reach him. That's it.


My majors at college are liberal arts, the kind that never gets you a job. But it's the only thing i'm good at, so what choice do i have? i suck at math and science, i'm not really skilled at crafting etc. and i'm heavily overweight and not in shape at all. what choice do i have? i did not attend college for the last few weeks, i couldnt not get myself to. well, at least i live in a country without tuition fees i guess...


I have a part-time job that i hate with all my heart. i'm not going into details here, but imagine a kind of customer support. all day i'm listening to stupid people with stupid problems. my coworkers are all lazy fucks. i make more calls in one hour than others do in a whole day, but still they earn more than i do, because i'm just a college student. I have not been to work for weeks, at monday I will have another doctor's appointment to see how things will go, but honestly? I pray I dont need to go again, like ever. But then again i'm feeling anxious about what people will think, talk? I already had a talk with my boss about my over-average sickness days... i don't want it again. 


I'm feeling so exhausted. ive been working since my first semester while my bf was unemployed for an entire year, sitting at home not doing shit. I put up with that, because I love him, yet I have the feeling he is already fed up with me doing the same, after a few weeks.


There's nothing that I really enjoy anymore. i spend most of my time sleeping (thanks meds, thats the only effect they really have) and playing videogames that i dont even like that much. I have not read a book in months because i just can not focus for too long. I hardly go out and if i do, I hate it. 


I am physically ill, too. I have light scoliosis and had my first attack of gout about 2 months ago, at the age of 22! I also have a gastro-intestinal disease of unknown cause with causes me to randomly have diarrhea about every second day. I'm not even starting with the things I believe to be side effects of my meds. My parents are sick too - my dad has depression, too (as well as my maternal grandmother - got it from both sides, hell yas) and my mother has Morbus Bechterew. which is partly genetic. hooray. oh and cancer also runs in the family. 

I have the feeling that the people around me are losing their patience and expect me to just put up with it finally, and i just can't. I have switched doctors two times in a few months because i did not feel welcome anymore. My boyfriend is the only one who listens to me, but well, is not like he can help me. I don't think he really understands me, and part of me is glad he doesn't - I do not want to drag him into my shit deeper than necessary.


Why do I even write all this? I don't know. I don't know anything anymore except that I really wish to die. I am afraid of the pain, and it's pretty hard for me to find a way to do it, which is why I'm still here. Everything in my life so far has been a huge pile of crap, and when I hear people say ""Youth is the best time of your life"" I shiver about what that implies what is about to come.


My family was religious once. We stopped attending some time, and even though my parents seem to still believe in a God, I don't. I can't see any reason why he would make me and million others suffer with this shit other than pure sadism. And I'd rather not believe in a God than in a sadistic one. 


I do not know when it will happen. Maybe tomorrow, maybe next week, maybe in a few months, but I'm almost certain it will happen, because chances that my life will ever turn good again are pretty damn low.

Hazeringx,5b7oo8,1478311096,I am a shitty teenager and I want to kill myself. I need help.,"Hi. This is not my first time on /r/suicidewatch and it won't be the last. I have tried to commit suicide almost 3 times, and I failed all of them, unfortunately. I am only 17 years old, yes, I am ""young"". Why do people feel like that just because I am young, I should want to live? Because I surely don't want to.

Why should I want to? I had a shitty childhood, shitty everything. I am just a 17 years old, kissless virgin who likes videos games and anime/manga. I have no one interested in me. I am probably mocked in my back. I am not interesting. 

No one is ever interested by me. Of course, it's not the only reason I want to kill myself. Life is just painful. I just get hurt and hurt others. I am not useful, and even when I am, no one cares. No one gives a flying fuck. 

Please, give me reasons to not kill myself. I already know I won't experience love, I am literally unlikable, I will probably be alone and single, also dying alone. I don't want to live anymore. Destroy me. **Erase** me from existence."

Sardonnicus,5cw49b,1479132716,I have a friend who is going through hard times and keeps talking about wanting to commit suicide. What can I do?,"I have a friend and co-worker who is going though very tough financial and marriage issues at the moment, and she keeps talking about her desire to commit suicide.  Long story short, Her husband lost his job and company car back in July.  She is now the sole earner in her family and is trying to support her Husband and 2 children on her salary, which is not that good.  In addition to working her regular 8-5pm job, to make ends meet, she also works as call operator for our company every evening and night.  So she has essentially been working around the clock since July.  Her husband has not been proactive about getting a new job and he has sort of ""checked out"" in helping around the house.  She says he refuses  to help clean, or cook, or do much of the ""home-maker"" duties while she is at work during the day and waits for her to come home and cook and do the laundry etc.  She says she feels, trapped and suffocating and is not sure how much longer she can last.  Her son also needs special ADHD treatment and behavioural counsuling which she cannot afford since her Husabnd lost his job.  So yeah, she is having some hard times.  She has attempted suicide in the past and her Brother committed slow suicide from Alcohol abuse.  I want to be able to help her, but honestly, I have no idea what to do.  I help her out by driving her back and forth from work since we live near each other so her husband can use the car to look for work or run errands, but I think she needs to talk to someone, a professional.  I don't think my advice is helping, or even qualifies as help.  I am honestly worried."

Every night I close my eyes I think about me hanging from a rope and that thought soothes me a lot. All the pain gone. I wish there were a way to reboot myself, but there isn't. I have no strength to live everyday. I force myself to wake up, to get ready, to go to work, to come back home and try to live a routine life. At work I think about not being alive anymore and that helps a lot.. The only solution I see is ceasing to exist.. I had begged for support but it is difficult to be taken seriously if you pretend that everything is fine externally.. All I yearned for is the feeling of being wanted, needed in his life.. I maybe oversensitive but all I wanted, only for a few months, only till the time was tough, was love, no 'jokes' about being happy when I am not around. Just a few words everyday about how much I mean to him. I fantasize about being in a fatal car accident, without hurting anyone else of course..

[deleted],5avbc5,1478155405,"I lost $15,000 gambling and will end it next week","I'm 19 and I started gambling in January because I had no friends and was disinterested in University. Today the effects compounded and I am -$11,000 in debt and with no savings. As a depressed guy, I didn't really care about losses, I wasn't exactly trying to ""win big"" and The consequences didn't phase me. I also failed all my university subjects and the university has ""terminated"" my enrolment.

The existing issues in my life that had me depressed and suicidal are now compounded by this debt I owe. It would take more than a year to pay off, leaving me scrapping off loose change; while still battling depression? Fuck that.

If there is a lesson to be learned, its don't gamble when you're depressed. Depression leaves you disillusioned and disconnected with the real world and  almost unaware of the financial consequences. You'll be left with another good reason to plan your death.

I'm not looking for money, Even if I had $11,000; a clean slate. I would still do it as the other issues in my life would still make leave me depressed for an undefined amount of time.

I'll soon have my nitrogen tank, and supplies. I hope it'll work because I'd hate to use a rope.

Wanttokillmyself2451,5bes35,1478418478,I feel like there's no one I can trust,"A month or two ago, I burst out into tears over a stupid argument and I got hysterical to the point it was clear something was up. I was arguing with my mom. She kept asking me what's wrong, and she kept prying. Then I let it all out. I told her about my past suicide attempt, how much I hate myself, the voices I hear, my self harm and everything. She told my dad and in her words it was because ""he had to know"". She said she wouldn't tell anyone else. I was fine with that but when she was making me type out a message to her coworker, I saw a past message she had sent. I had just gotten out of the psych ward as I was suicidal (this happened a few weeks ago) and she told her coworker everything. All the stuff she promised to keep a secret. I later found out she also told my step dad, my step sister and likely more people. Today she asked me what the time was so I pressed the home button on her phone. There was a message from her half brother visible and it was pretty clear she had told him too. She promised me. But she told all these people. I feel so humiliated, they know all about the part of me that I was going to take to the grave. They may as well be fucking strangers, I don't know them well at all. But they know my biggest (former) secret.

For about 6 years now, I've had a friend in my head. I call her 'boss'. She talks to me and comforts me and she helps me through things I otherwise couldn't do. She's my best friend. But I had a moment of realisation a week ago that she's not real. I was aware already but I never really thought about how it's just me. Boss is just me, there's no one there. It made me feel so horribly alone. Lately I've been having suicidal thoughts at least once a day. Boss usually talks me out of them but it just doesn't work anymore because whenever she starts to convince me it's not a good idea, I just think ""wait, you're not real"". Boss was the only person I could trust, but now I realise I can't trust anyone.

I have 2 friends but we're not close, we just sit together to give ourselves company.

I used to have lots of friends until a sting of massive fights broke out. They said such horrible hurtful things to me that even months later, it still hurts me. I thought they were the kindest people in the world. But they ended up being bullies, just fucking bullies. They spread rumours about me, they talk shit about me, they try and get my only 2 friends to turn against me. Who the fuck can I trust if such seemingly genuine people can just do a complete 180?

well my dad... I can't trust him either. He gets violent sometimes

I haven't got anyone. I want someone, but at the same time I don't. Because I'm so scared they'll hurt me."
CRBthrowaway,5e2ql5,1479711010,I've been thinking lately that I want to kill myself.,"I woke up last night and couldn't get back to sleep for a couple hours. All I could think was how much I didn't want to be here. I feel like the only reason I'm living is because of the few people that would be sad if I died. My family and my boyfriend. I know it's really fucked up of me to be complaining about how much I hate life when there are people who care about me. Honestly though, my boyfriend is only into me because he's also suicidal and I'm emotional support for him. He doesn't know I've been like this. And my family are just good people so they naturally care about me. They're the main reason I haven't gone through with it. Just because I feel like I'd be selfish to them if I did.

There was a girl, who was a friend of a girl I go to school with, who killed herself earlier this month. I've been creeping on this girl's Facebook. And this girl was crazy popular. She was a humanitarian who was involved in a bunch of charities and she was super involved in her school. She was athletic and really pretty. She just seemed like she would probably had the kind of life I would want. But even she had her own demons. 

It made me think. I always think that the reason I'm depressed is because I feel like most people don't pay much attention to me. I've always tried to be outgoing and talkative. But for some reason I don't have friends. I don't know what I am doing wrong. But I just feel unimportant. I feel like I'm always left out. But I think even if I did have these things, I'd still be depressed. There's just something in my brain that is fucked up. 

I wish my boyfriend wasn't suicidal. I mean mostly cause I love him and don't want him to feel that way. But then I wouldn't feel guilty about breaking up with him so he can move on from me. Then one day I would just run away. Or do something horrible to make my family hate me. And then I could just do it. I could just end it all and be done with this world. "

[deleted],5cyvsl,1479162674,I'm still here,"I had it all worked out. An empty 5th of Crown Royal haphazardly lying next to an empty bottle of Xanax. The idea being my family thinking I got extremely fucked up and wandered off into the woods and did something ""while not in a proper state of mind"" so that they wouldn't think it was too premeditated. In reality the whiskey has been empty for weeks and I've just been taking small amounts of Xanax (but the bottle is now, unfortunately, actually empty). I was going to do it sober, without anyone knowing that I was perfectly sane and sober when I decided to pull that trigger. Yet here I still am.

I've been getting really stoned the past few nights, and why not? You don't have to worry about drug tests when you're dead. And last night I came to the conclusion that,*if I really wanted to*, I could fix every single one of my problems. It may take a long time, but it's absolutely possible to one day have the life of my dreams. And by killing myself, I'm basically saying I'm too *lazy* to even *try*. 

So today came. ""The"" day. And I thought about all this. I thought about the extra struggles I will have to go through now after completely wiping out my bank account over the weekend and dirtying up my piss with no job or no job prospects and work that needs to be done on my car. It started seeming bleak again, and then I got an email notifying me of a refund check I should be getting in the mail for something soon. I forgot all about that. I don't know how much it will be but if it's enough to cover the most immediate concerns, then maybe there is still hope after all. I could get a job that doesn't drug test for the time being, one that tips like bartending, and take it one day at a time.

It's never going to get better. I can't do anything. I will always have this heavy sadness inside me. And I have to wait so long to get rid of it! I wish I could plan for my death now. I wish I was estranged from my family or that they abused me because it would be easier to leave.

However, I could save them from further disappointment if I just get it over with already. All I'd have to do is go to sleep and not wake up. But I can not imagine the shame that would come if I did wake up. I don't know anymore. The worst part is I am not even feeling that depressed or the darkness that usually came with these thoughts. I feel like I have decided I should flip a coin or choose to just finish this already. It has gone on far too long. I am setting up support networks right now and striving to keep going but I feel like if I falter then it could be the end of me. Counseling and therapy is not helping. No, I am not actively at risk.

I just burden people and there's no chance I'll live beyond breaking even. I could actually end it. I don't know how painful it'd be but I think I'd just go to sleep and be done. Everyone would be better for it.
Genuinelycuriousd,5bm0uz,1478523932,Why do you care if other people kill themselves,"I'm genuinely curious about why people try to convince others not to die. We all die eventually anyhow. Where is the big tragedy in a life ending a few years sooner? We don't even know what death means so what makes you all so adamant about the notion that people should ""hold on"" or ""keep going""?"
Melancholy_Boy,5d57j6,1479245468,Sometimes it's hard.,"Sometimes it's hard for me to continue walking in this world. I have thoughts about leaving it everyday. 

I'm a smiling boy. I love to laugh, hang out with friends, listen to music. I go to some kids houses to give class and earn some money. I study at the University.  I'm not ugly but I'm not handsome, I even like my face. I'm pretty clever too. You see, it looks like everythings goes right in my life. I'm a normal guy. But I don't feel right. I never completely do. There's is always this anxiety in me that makes me feel like shit. I'm happy when I'm out of home, in class I feel surounded by friends and people, but when it finishes, I'm all alone. There's never no one waiting for me, my father is just always complaining about everything, I don't have a mother. I live in this big empty house, spending afternoons all alone on my computer when I'm not teaching. I have a boyfriend, but he lives like 2 hours or 3 from where I live, and we can't see each other oftenly. Sometimes I feel he doesn't love. I am deep in love with him and this thought I have hurts me a lot. I see everyone's life so easy, their parents give them enough money, buy them clothes, etc etc. I feel empty and lonely. I don't have a family, I don't have any messages on my phone to answer, not even his. I feel abandoned sometimes. I want to leave this world, but I have strong thoughts about staying here. I still enjoy music, food, a good conversation... I need someone to talk to. I now it's kind of a mess of a post, but I just don't even know where to start and how to tell you how I feel. I try my best. Thanks for reading."
tapandabear,5enlg7,1479991789,Happy Thanksgiving...,"I should be thankful for all the blessings in my life right? Yeah... I've been depressed for a while now and started having suicidal thoughts for the past couple months.

Went through all of education not really learning much and was very shy. Rarely spoke to anyone and can barely have a conversation that isn't about myself or the weather. I've gotten a seasonal job working in retail and can't even help the customers there. Instead i spend my time freaking out constantly not knowing what to do. 

I am ungrateful for all of these opportunities life has offered to me. I just want to stop existing but not kill myself. Is that weird?"
JohnnyCashback,5cmj5j,1478985676,I don't think I'm depressed anymore,"I can hardly remember a time when I haven't been feeling suicidal. I clearly remember stating that ""maybe It would be better if I weren't alive"" when I was in grade/primary/elementary/whatever you like to call it school. At some point in my late teens it dawned on me that apparently, you're not supposed to feel like shit all the time, and maybe, something was wrong with my psyche. My mother had been hospitalized for depression for a few weeks, or months, when I was young. Being at least somewhat hereditary, and - at least in popular usage - synonymous with ""chronically sad"", that sounded like a good guess.

Now, almost 10 years later, I'm finally at a point where I no longer know what to do. Basically, there's two options in front of me: end my life, or have myself institutionalized. There's no middle ground here, I've tried it all. I've tried to give myself time to sort my issues out on my own without a lot of other stuff to do. That hasn't done anything. I have taken medication (SSRI) and spoken to therapists (like 5 of them by now). Admittedly, the longest I've gone was like 10 sessions, and I understand that that probably doesn't treat anything. But the problem here is the same as if I signed myself up for psych ward: I'm probably not depressed.

I'm not too much on an expert on psychological diagnoses, but I'd say depression is when you're feeling down even you don't really have a reason to (or at least disproportionately so). There sure have been periods in my life where this has described what I was feeling very well. But not anymore. I can precisely identify what makes me feel sad. Also, I don't meet the DSM-5 criteria for major depressive disorder. Maybe those for persistent depressive disorder, with a bit of a stretch. But even if that's the case, depression is not the root cause.

So what if I go to a mental hospital because I'm suicidal? I guess they'll want to treat me for depression. At least, that's what they are good at.

Some time ago, I read a question in another thread, something like ""Do you have an idea of what should change for you to no longer be depressed?"" Apparently, most people in this position don't, and thinking about this triggers some sort of epiphany. Well, I don't know either. But for me, it just underlines my point: maybe, there is no help for me.

Edit: Oops, I kind of left out the main part. Well. If you look at me from the outside, I seem to have a pretty good life. I have lots of talents, a nice education and like what I do in my field. I don't have financial problems, supportive parents and several good friends. No substance abuse or early childhood trauma (although my parents are divorced, but in probably the most civil manner possible). Quite some bullying in school, and I'm sure any psychologist will jump on this (and the divorce) as the root of all evil, but, even if that were true, not really relevant today. What is, however, missing in my life, is love. And here's the thing: In this department, my emotions work completely, utterly different from everyone* else's. Because I have never been able to let go, to move on, or to simply have a ""let's see what develops"" attitude. For me, this is a dead serious thing from the moment I meet somebody.

Now you're probably thinking, okay, recent breakup or something, time heals all wounds, plenty of fish, bla bla. But I'm way beyond that. Think of somebody lamenting that they are kicked out of college due to some misfortune, cannot get the qualifications for $decent\_job, aren't hired, have to spend their life working minimum wage. For me, it's the same thing just with ""job"" replaced by ""love interest"". And this comes from a deep trait of my personality: **one that I would never want to change**. Because if the only thing that could ""help"" me would be if I cared less about those I love, would it really?

So, yeah. I know nobody will advise me to catch the bus here. But can anyone even try to convince me that seeking help has anything to offer?"
ASTOLENHOBO,5cmj8r,1478985708,I don't know what to do....,"For the past few years I've been feeling all alone, even with people around. I can make friends but can't seem to keep people around that actually care. Even when I'm in a group I feel isolated and like I'm watching them from the outside.  Now lately I haven't been wanting to live, I don't want to kill myself but I don't want to live anymore. "
MenieresDiseases,5btqds,1478617888,I want to die but not to be a burden on my family.,"I've never been diagnosed with depression or anything like that, but I've always had some sort of hate towards being alive. With Meniere's Diseases I get constant migraines/headaches and weekly to monthly vertigo attacks. I've wanted to end myself so many times but I'm too afraid to do so but with losing my girlfriend just recently it feels like that might be the nail in the coffin and I just want to feel loved or feel like someone knows my pain. I am in constant agony but I don't want to tell someone because I am afraid. I love my family very much and don't want to hurt them by letting them see my still corpse in my room or in the bathroom. I don't want to end it just yet, but it hurts to just continue moving forward. For Meniere's Diseases treatments don't help as It's not usual for people my age to get such a disease. Depression runs in my family but I don't know if I should bring this up or just let the course run. I just am scared that I may go to far beyond the point of no return and truly end it all no matter how comforting it sounds. 

Sorry for any broken English, I am still rather distraught and currently lightheaded from my illness."
serial_32,5bivn0,1478475533,Lost faith in humanity,"What with everything that is happening with the Presidential Election, people shouting at each other in the streets over childish debates. One of my closest friends came out and said that he didn't mind ""locker room talk"", which made me rethink and mistrust pretty much everyone that I know. I thoroughly despise my father and stepmother, taking their opinions as even more ignorance and pointing fingers. I don't believe that they would truly miss me if I were to kill myself, and when I've tried voicing my feelings to them, they tell me that I am only delusional and hormonal. If this continues for any longer, I'm most likely to jump from a building. I am not afraid if this is my last year alive. I simply don't want to live in a world that is so consumed with selfishness and greed. "

I have social anxiety and have very few friends(their not real friends) nothing makes me happy. I have never had a girlfriend. I know i will die alone, so why not end it know.

crimsonladyton,5fl7ud,1480453076,I don't know if it's depression or I'm just tired.,"I woke up feeling like shit, physically. . which is fine. It totally matches my mental state. Gives me a reason to hide. 

In the past two weeks, I ruined my relationship with my sister and my best friend of 28 years. I told them I would. I said I would systematically remove myself from everyone's lives, as to not be a menace to them anymore. 

The problem is that I have 5 kids and 3 grandkids to think about. But, honestly, besides the grands, no one even bothers with me. Unless they want to blame me for something or ask me for something. They hate me and they show their residual childhood hate for me. They will hug me when they see me, ask how I'm doing. But, guess what? Out of sight out of mind right? The grands are too young to remember me. Except the oldest,who's 8. Who I love more than any single person or thing on this planet (same for the 2 other grands). Literally, the ONLY thing that makes me smile is my grandchildren. They are the only thing that gives me a feeling of joy or elation. 

Nothing else does anymore. I'm filled with stone inside. My face used to be one of those that whatever emotion I was feeling, anyone could see it written all over me. And I had plenty of emotions. Too many. My emotions are what drive me to this point, to being and feeling insane. I have worries that most of my friends and family would say is unfounded. They think that because they RESPOND to a text or call, that they're engaged in my life. They're not. I'm the mother of 5 and I find out everything about them thru facebook. Engagements, moves, jobs and anything else. Always the last fucking one to know! I wish my dad were here. Even tho he hated me, I could scream, yell and be crazy around him, he'd deal with it and then call me crazy, I would cry, he would make me a drink and we'd talk all night. He did understand me. He didn't like me and told me I'm shit, so he did understand me.

He wasn't the best man, he  wasn't even close. He did some things that people usually go to prison for. Lots of things. Including one thing I've never told a soul, but maybe I'll just put it down here. I don't know, I'm afraid because he died 2 months ago and it feels like defiling the dead. I need to tell someone. Not now, I have to think.

He was a biker. A rough guy. Always in leathers and boots. He lost a leg dropping a Harley on it and burning a hole thru his calve. He asked me to go live with him since I was the one available. Single, 40 and just graduated college. No real roots anymore. Not since I left my family home in Florida and separated from my long time husband. Oh, was there a reason for that! I got everything I deserved. I'm still taking it.

I went and lived with him and tried to care for the house, him and the dog. For awhile it was great, we got along and we had fun. Then we started arguing. Then I could feel myself coming apart. Like at any minute of any hour, I would bust thru my skin and turn into a nothing more than a puddle on the floor. Disinegrated, finally. I started to remember the things he's done. It started to bother my daily and I tried to push it down. I don't know how anyone couldl stay sane while living with the father that molested them. I loved him, tho. He did that and I loved him so much anyway. Always trying to get his approval. I didn't. I never did. How fucked up am I, that I would love someone. I have to do it now. 2 paragraphs up: My heart is pounding and my laptop is shaking with my typing. Ihave to say this, to you and I'm sorry. I watched my father begin to molest my little sister. I got up for school one morning (this was in high school) and I went to her room to make sure she was up. He was sitting on her bed just rubbing her butt as she slept. It wasn't fatherly. No one on this planet knows this but you. Everyone knows he molested my aunts.

Not my first experience with molesters. I had 4, I think. I had the babysitter at 3, a male who forced me to perform oral sex on him (my father told me I made it up and was too young to remember something like that). I had a stepfather from ages 10-14 who molested me the whole time. The usual, come to my room at night and touch me, stand next to my bed and masturbate. I also watched him molest my aunt in the same room when I was 10. He thought I was sleeping. Let's see, I had the stepfathers friend who enjoyed sharing the backseat with me,whilke my parents were in the front. He pretended to fall asleep on me while he fondled me. I think I was around 11. Was that it? Oh, once, no real big deal, my father was drunk when I was 19. I had just had a baby, my son when he I went to his house. I had 3 kids with me. He got up and pushed a button on the VCR and a porno popped up. He left it and walked outside. I quickly got up to change it and nervously sat back down. He had said he was on new meds, so I thought maybe he forgot I'm even here. But, he walked back in and did it again, and walked out. I changed it back once more. I was standing up leaning down to lookat my baby son in his carrier, and my dad walked by, grabbed the front of my shirt and practically put his head down it and says ""nice"". I grabbed my kids and went to my BFF's house. Who now hates me, she was systematically cut out, also. So, there's all that.

I stayed there for 2 years with my dad helping his one legged self. While there, I got rehooked on pain meds and I was stealing shots of his rum all day. I lost it finally, of course. You knew that would happen. I went to a detox, a rehab and a mental facility all in 2 or 3 months. Right before that, I had a total hysterectomy due to some bullshit female stuff. I was a mess. Sometime between facilities, I blacked out from drinking. The last thing I remember was pulling out one of his many guns and pointing it at my head and pulling the trigger. It was the only gun in that area that was unloaded. Figures. I left and went to recooperate at my mothers. She's about the only one that I won't push away, even when I get the urge to. I need her. She loves me for me and when I'm with her, I can almost feel me there.

My mother was also not the best. She was very abusive and she was a little slutty. She had 5 marriages and we moved a lot. Once I moved out, with a new baby at 17 years old, I didn't talk to her much. I blamed her for every bad emotion, every drink and every pill I took. It took until I was 38 years old to get close to her again. Why then? Because she was the only one to check up on me or come save me from a very long stay at a state mental facility. My husband had made statements that I was indigent and many other horrible things that were and weren't true. The result was that I go to the state hospital and only a judge would've been able to release me. My mother showed up there, claimed me, went to my house and got my things and took me to her house in Alabama. It's quiet and so cozy there. Perfect place for a convalescent home. My mother let me cry out my pain on her shoulders, her floor and her soul. She held while I screamed at God for giving me such a fucked life. I had lost it all, my kids, my home and myself. Really tho, half of me was gone. Has been. The way my marriage was and the way I raised my kids, a whole other story.

My mother and I are best friends now. She doesn't know a lot about me, tho. She does because she knows the silly fun daughter side of me. She doesn't know half the time I was doing drug deals to get mine and other stuff she would have kicked me out for. I was good to her tho, and she was good to me. She's happy now. She's retired and taking care of her home. I hope to go back soon,.

My daughter had a baby, my grand daughter. She asked me to come stay with her and help with daycare, its expensive. So, here I am now. The ONLY thing that gives me joy are these kids. But, Ive given up a lot for a daughter that barely tolerates being around me. She corrects me constantly if Isay or do anything she considers stupid or out of line. Like when I told her something about something and used the word ""straight"", like as in, ""You'll be straight once you get your room organized"".....said its for young people to use. I see something in her eyes every single time she looks at me. I'm the first one she snaps at when she's upset, which is most of the time. I don't know what the look is. Sometimes I think it's her trying to figure me out. Sometimes I think it's pure loathing. I want to go back to my mothers. I gave up everything. Half my belongings are strewed throughout their house. I have no money out of the 8 grand I had after dad passing because I moved them to a new house as they were evicted from the other one. Everything of my dads that I have is now in her husbands ""man cave"". I have a little pile of dads stuff. Why would I even want it, you ask? I don't know. I still loved my dad. He was still the person I went to for help, financially and if I just needed to act out because I was feeling crazy brained at the time. That's why.

They fight so much here. Every single time, my heart races, my anxiety goes thru the roof and I want to cry. I really don't know why it affects me that way. I don't know. It happens a lot. I'm an idiot, that's why.
Growing up I was never ugly and thought thru my teen years that the way to get a boy to like you, was you just had to fuck him. So, I fucked everyone. I wanted friends and to be liked. This attitude got me no friends but I continued the destructive behavior until......well, until my hysterectomy. I miss all those crazy emotions I used to have. I have none, now. Zilch.

Right now, I feel like this: I'm 44, single, 5 grown kids, no house and never lived alone, no career, even tho I'm educated, no money at all, no feelings, no friends around this area and the far away ones don't bother anymore. I'm feeling like I have to stay in my ""grandma box"" in this house, I don't dare step out and be myself (which I think used to be a little silly and fun), or risk my daughter getting mad at me. I clean thier house, I do their laundry and I care for their kids. The only 2 things that keeps me going, those kids. But, they are young,. They won't remember me.

After writing this, I'm even more convinced my heart is turning to stone. I have NO emotions, people! I'm either crazy or there is something physically wrong with me. I have no way of going to check out whats going on with any doctor. There are free clinics around here. Doctors in a box. You think I'd go tell them all this? Nope, I'd be right back in some facility. I will not go back there again. In my lifetime, I've been under mental evaluation around 20 times, maybe more.

I'm done, ya'll. I have nothing. I have nothing. I have nothing. I lost my friends and my only sister. My sister can't deal with my mental stuff and just brags about how rich she is, she really is. Just spent the holidays in Hawaii for a week. Must fucking be nice. She told me about that upcoming trip right after I told her that I felt crazy again and Ithibk I needed help. 

Nothing's left. My family will breathe a collective sigh of relief. I'm a burden that has nothing of her own anymore. I've created messes every where I go. Maybe I just hate myself this much. I do, tho. When I look in the mirror, I say ""I hate you , you fucking stupid bitch"". I've written it my journals. I have scars everywhere from being a god dam cutter. HOW FUCKING STUPID IS THAT? Everyone already knows that this is how I end. I'm sure they saw it coming.  
I'm not one to do things that are serious without preparing.  Man, I used to be  able to jump up and create fun for myself and anyone around me. Haha, definitely not anymore. Anyway, I'm not going to do anything unless I'm 100 percent prepared. It's early in the day, it's early in the week and it's early in the month. Christmas, fucking Christmas is coming soon. Now, that'd be fucked up. To leave during the holidays. That kinda would mess people up for every holiday to come. I'm not mean, just disturbed. I won't do that to them. 

Can't mess up this time. Has to be drama free. When I left Florida and my family (when mom came to get me from the mental facility), I was there in that hospital for hanging myself in my backyard. Climbed a tree with a sheet, tied it up and around my neck, jumped off the chair. Woke up in the hospital. Always so much drama.

I know better this time. Solitude is what it will take. Go somewhere away from them. I'll just be found by a stranger. Apologies in advance, stranger.
But, like I said, I think I have a little time to work out all the quirks.

In case you're wondering, I'm 100 percent clean right now, have been since july when I came to help my daughter out. I've done absolutely nothing since then. This is no drug or alcohol induced rant. I wish, might feel better. 




























I have a New Year's resolution, Ya'll!"

Gayification,5amst0,1478045770,My last hope has fallen apart.,"I [20M] have been going downhill my whole life, but for the past two years or so I've spiraled out of control. For the past year I have wanted to die, and things got so unbearable I failed out of college and had to come back home. I've mentioned this in other posts, but my home is where all of this started and I absolutely hate this place because of it. I cannot handle being here and I would rather die than be stuck here any longer, but I had no money or job to leave. My family kept saying they'd help but they weren't doing anything, meanwhile I was panicking and deteriorating every day. Now I've been here 6 months and I feel ready to die, so a week and a half ago I just bought a ticket to Chicago and decided I'd go. My family was afraid of me being homeless or in a shelter so they decided to try and help me, but nobody would rent a place to me. I got my hopes up thinking that things would finally start to get better for me for the first time and now they've just fallen apart. I got my hopes up, nobody would rent a place to me, and I don't know anybody there.

I'd rather kill myself than be here any longer, but I have no job, work history, credit, or anything else I'd need to have a life in the world. I think my time is just up. I can't stay here and I can't move. I won't stay here longer, no matter what that means for me."
jeramiatheaberator,5b0wwf,1478223717,My take on depression,"So I cried a little while writing this, but here it goes. I was bullied a lot in middle school, worst years of my life. No advice adults gave me worked. I almost took a rock to a kids head once. High school was better, I had friends and the bullies either got bored or moved on. College has been ok, but I've been pretty lonely lately. Some friends have drifted away a little and most of my new friends are nothing but acquaintances. It hurts a lot , when someone invites someone sitting next to me to hang out at a bar, knowing very well that they don't drink, but not inviting me. It hurts when I tell someone to let me know if they are going to hang out, only to see group pictures of them hanging out a week later. It hurts to feel alone and have no one to blame but yourself, because they have no obligation to include or invite me, but I get left out so often that I feel fucking alone. My best friend told me something that really hit home to me the other day. I guess he's been pretty sad lately, maybe a little depressed, he told me that teachers told him that he seems sad that day, and he told me ""I guess I forgot my mask today"" I'm not suicidal btw, just really lonely and I found this sub and reading a few posts made me want to write this wall of text, so if you made it this far thank you and I hope you are having a nice day"
throwaway399r9,5ci17y,1478912146,I am not adjusting well,"I've never actually posted on Reddit before. I don't post on social media often - I'm insecure. I don't really want people to see me. 

I'm really struggling. Ever since I was a kid, I've had a difficult time handling and regulating my emotions. I haven't actually been diagnosed with anything, although I've been in therapy off and on several times since I was little. I know I am depressed, and I am almost 100% certain I'm also experiencing generalized anxiety disorder. 

I can't function. It seems like every year brings something newer and more difficult without something good in equal weight. I can't pretend that there aren't good things in my life or that I don't have opportunities. I just feel so heavy. All the time.
I started dating my boyfriend a little under a year and a half ago, though we've been friends for over six. He's amazing, he truly is, and I have no idea where I'd be physically, mentally, or emotionally without him. A couple months after we started dating, he confessed that he was struggling with depression (which was ongoing for him, as well) and talked about suicidal thoughts. He didn't have much of a support system where he was going to school and ended up moving back into his mom's house. He has a good relationship for her, but he was basically in the same situation, just a different place. He and I were ""long-distance"" at the time, but could usually see each other twice a month. Every day I would wake up, go to work, go to school, come home and do homework, then talk on the phone with him for hours at a time while we played games together. Video games aren't really my thing, but we found some that we both liked to play, plus it gave us both a way to distract ourselves. Sometimes he would disappear for a day. Sometimes I could tell he was extremely drunk when he texted me. Sometime the things he said didn't make sense at all. He was hurting. It took a toll on me even though I was willing to do anything to help him. It killed me to know the person I loved was hurting and that I couldn't do anything about it.

I was focused on him, but there was still so much else I needed to pay attention to. My longest, truest, best, and most fulfilling friendship fell apart and I don't know if we'll ever be friends again. I moved out of my abusive stepfather's household to a new city with her after I graduated high school - we lived together for nearly four years and were friends for almost six. We weren't mature enough when we were younger to communicate when things were wrong in our relationship, and so neither of us said anything when we were displeased with each other. It built up. We got in arguments about money - she rarely paid rent on time and we were getting shutoff notices from our utilities. I got home one day last January after my first day of the new semester, working, and running errands all over town without a car to find a shutoff notice for the electricity after getting a notice from our landlord the day before. I felt out of control, like I was being overlooked. She didn't seem to care. I couldn't move back in with my parents like she could if we got evicted and couldn't find a new place (which was likely). Something in me snapped, we argued, we stopped talking, she didn't pay, she told me she was moving out, and that was that. We've talked a few times, but I'm still angry. I'm sure she is, too. 

My boyfriend moved in, and things were good for awhile. I finished my last full semester at the community college I was attending with only one summer class left, and with good grades. Our apartment was starting to feel like home, and it was so good to finally have him by my side. His mental health got better. He found a job here that he loves and has been happy and healthy for over seven months now. 

Summer was when my mental health got really bad. I started seeing a therapist again at the end of April. Cognitive behavioral therapy has been helpful, but honestly sometimes I can't focus enough to try to change what I'm thinking or feeling. The only thing that gets me out of my head is distraction, and I'm convinced the buildup just shows up later. If one more person suggests I meditate, I swear to God...anyway. ALL of my friends moved away, aside from the friendship that fell apart. So now I am mostly alone and feeling guilty for putting my mental illness on no one but my boyfriend. I started at a four-year university this semester, and I am not adjusting to it. I feel out of place, I feel weird, I feel unfocused and less ambitious and driven than them. I'm intelligent, but I can't focus on anything anymore. I'm so tired all the time. I'm only taking 11 credits but I feel like I'm constantly dragging my feet. I was working 30 hours a week, managing the coffee shop where I met all of my friends that I made here. I had to quit, I just couldn't do it anymore. In retrospect, I left one of the only safe places I had left, no matter how much it stressed me out. 
Suicide is always at the back of my mind. I haven't talked to anyone about it, not even my counselor. I'm scared to give up any freedom I have by admitting I have these thoughts. I haven't told my boyfriend, but I'm almost certain that he knows. He called off work the other day because I was in such bad shape and knew I needed someone to be with me. Sometimes it doesn't even come from a particular stressor. Sometimes it just starts - I feel heavy and my throat swells up, and I cry all the time. I cry so much. I can't stop. I hate being in public, especially at school. I don't know how to move or how to interact with people. I'm so tired. No one I talk to understands. I can't make myself understood. 
I don't think I'm going to kill myself. I've made it through hard times before, although they didn't last this long and weren't as intense. I'm going to Planned Parenthood to change my birth control method next week, which I'm praying is going to help. I have to find a new counselor because mine is no longer going to be counseling. If I'm still having trouble after being off the pill for awhile, I'm going to ask for a prescription. I need to be out of this hole. I need to be lighter. I need to find some sort of light in the world again."

That I'm gonna just be basically a wage slave working for nothing.

My life is forcing me into a position where I'd rather slit my wrists than live in but I have no other choice. There aren't any full-time jobs around here that I qualify for either as this is just one big college town. Everything caters to those guys and I just feel stuck."
throwitaway_garbage,5b1uja,1478236504,"The confessions of an entitled, yet confused, piece of shit.","So, I'm not sure where to begin with any of this but I feel like I just need to get this off my chest, I suppose. Quick background: I was raised in a Christian home, parents are high school sweethearts, been together for 30+ years, the only people I'm close with are my siblings and girls I've been in relationships with. I've been concerned with the afterlife even before I hit puberty. One of my earliest memories is having a discussion with my mom about the existence of God. Suicide is something I’ve thought about since before some of my early memories. The two things keeping me alive are my family and the fear of afterlife. Now, if I imagine a life where my family was gone for some reason, I can see myself following through with the thoughts I've had. I was always eager to please and being raised religious the easiest way with that was by being a devout Christian. But, that quickly changed because after turning 18 and moving out I experimented with drugs and drank every night. Smoked a pack a day, drank to the point of throwing up every night, and took whatever drugs were available at the time. I’m not even sure of the exact drugs I had taken during the years after high school graduation. I really don’t want to describe any more of my life without revealing too many details. What I’m trying to say is now I’m 25 and those same thoughts haven’t gone away. I have an extremely blessed upbringing and I still see and abuse the benefits from my parents. I’ve been studying mechanical engineering and doing very well in my core classes while simultaneously thinking of what I want to do with my future. What I do with this, I have no idea. Sometimes I feel like I’m not meant for this world. This is a constant conversation I have with myself. That I’m not meant for this world. I feel like I’m not meant for this time period or just this reality. People are so fucked up and I’m just as fucked up as they are. In a time of narcissistic sociopaths, I feel like I am one of the worst. I don’t mean the worst like I’m going to destroy humankind or anything like that, but as if I’m just fucked up in my own way. I’m empathetic, yet I know how to take advantage of it. I can read what is going on internally with everyone I come into contact with and I know how to play it to my advantage. I don’t always do it, but I know I can. Sometimes, I wish I didn’t have a conscience so I could just do it. But I’m so stuck in between good and bad, right and wrong, it drives me insane. I wish I could give my life to someone who could use it more effectively or to someone who could actually see the value in the type of upbringing I’ve had. As someone who has been looking for answers through different drugs and introspection, I can’t say I’ve found anything that way. It seems as though the answers we seek are inside us individually. The purpose for our own lives is just that, it’s the purpose for us individually. How do we get this purpose? We literally make it up. Pick something, do it, live it. I wanted so many different things, but I’m beginning to recognize my sociopathic tendencies and it negates any kind of true chance of a genuine future. Some days I want to see how far I can go as an individual, and others I want to end it. Call me egotistical, but I couldn’t leave my family with broken hearts. I’m not sure if I’m looking for answers with this post or just typing out how I feel. "
ObligatoryAlt,5cud3f,1479100957,Please help me help my brother (x/post depression),"This is a bit long and complicated, but basically my older brother (23) is in his final year of college and having a massively awful time. That's an understatement though, from what he tells me he lives in constant fear of his grades no matter how hard he works, suffers from panic attacks, loathes himself, has no real friends (only ""placeholders""), and tells me that if it weren't for his family and solace of home he would have killed himself already... 

I only learned about this today though, before I knew him as somebody who pushed through any circumstance no matter the challenge. He's highly charismatic and loving, and seems to make friends quickly when he's in new workplaces. He's very hardworking at work, but seems to struggle in other areas of casual life I guess. He always came across as level headed and ambitious, but now it seems like he's afraid all of his work will collapse at any moment. He says that no matter how hard he works his grades seem to be unsteady. I believe everything that he told me, but now as his brother (20) I feel helpless.

 I want to do everything in my power to show him that he can do it and he has the strength. He's always been an inspiration to me, which I've told him. But I don't want to sugarcoat it and tell him he'll make it through that last year of college, because I can't tell the future. 

What can I do? What should I do? What shouldn't I do?

I usually left her blog alone, because I knew she vented there and i didn't want to infringe on her privacy. But I accidentally saw something concerning a few weeks ago about not knowing how longer she could go on, and I check back today and it's a story about how she wants to die more and more as time goes on. I've known she gets depressed, I do too..and I honestly live for her, because I was at a place in my life where I didn't care to exist any more. She said in that post that she knows people love her, and that she has a great job and pets, friends, and a boyfriend (me), she loves all of them..but she still wanted to stop in traffic while crossing the street. It said she knows I'll get tired of her at some point even though I've told her I can handle anything for her..and I have told her that. It ended with ""something will happen soon"" and I really don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to make things worse but if i do nothing and something awful happens..if she dies i know it will cost two lives. My life isn't the point here though. I need to find a way to help her. I'm sure a lot of you have been depressed at some point or another so you know that someone saying their there for you doesn't help a lot of times. And I know even when she's feeling awful she won't wake me up if I'm asleep because she doesn't want to worry or bother me even though I've asked her to. I'm really terrified at this point. "

anonnnadkshkymous,5e8ctf,1479782989,how can I talk to someone who will be rational instead of adamantly anti-suicide?,"the second rule of this subreddit specifically bans pro-suicide posts. I feel like this attitude is everywhere, and I understand why, but it's stopping me from getting help. If I know someone just wants to prevent suicide, they're not going to be honest with me, so I feel like there's no point talking to them.

I've lived with depression, chronic fatigue and chronic pain for nearly 30 years, and recently lost my life partner who I had been with for six years. I'm facing a life of incurable depression (yes I know with moments of happiness that are ""worth living for"" for healthy people), chronic fatigue and chronic pain. 

I am at a stage in my life where a number of different circumstances and lack of commitments make now the best time for me to make this decision to not continue with a life of suffering, and I know that in future my circumstances will never be this ideal. 

But I feel like there is no one I can talk to, because everyone has the default attitude of just 'prevention' without thinking about when it *might* be the best option. I am trying to be rational about this and make the right decision, but I have no one who will help me make it *rationally*.

I know you cannot respond to this with something that is seen as 'pro-suicide', but you can pm me or reply to tell me if you think it's best I make the decision on my own."

ColgarSinVida,5e25tf,1479701939,I hate so much about the way I am,"I can't stand myself. I'm depressed and hate myself for being so pathetic. I can't bring myself to do any schoolwork because I just don't see the point. I hate university, I'm not failing but I'm close to it, for a couple of my classes. I really just want everything to end. There's a bridge near my house, and every day I force myself not to jump off, because there's a small part of me that is stupid enough to think I'll go anywhere in life. 

I hate myself for being so pathetic, been hung up on the same person for 2.5 years, knowing full well that a relationship there will never happen, cause if I have this much self-loathing it's a certainty that other people pick up on that; or at least they know I'm not a fun person to be around. I have 4 projects due this coming week and I haven't started any of them, but I don't really care. I'm so annoyed at myself, but not motivated to do anything about it. 

For the past few months I've just been thinking about suicide almost constantly. I've told a couple people this and they don't care. Could be they don't believe me, could be they have their own shit to deal with, but probably is cause they see me how I see me: pathetic and not worth the effort.

switzerandlaffer,5b8nob,1478326375,Hello darkness my old friend,"As the song goes ""hello darkness my old friend, I've come to talk to you again"".

And so I am back here. This all pervading sense of despair. Loneliness. Am I feeling sorry for myself?

I am so selfish. But I don't want to be? Why do I feel like this. See the problem with that phrase: I. It's all about me! But how do I not make it be?

I (seems I cannot stop using the word for more than a sentence) try. 

Oh look I just can't write anything without using the word i. Let's just stop beating around the bush and just use the word I like the selfish bastard you are.

I have tried. Haven't I? Really. Maybe I haven't? I agree I deserve this. I am shit and have brought pain and misery to all around me. This is what happens. This is karma.

It's killing me. It's killing me. I go in and out. Up and down. Mostly down. 

People say the ultimate selfish act is to end it. Commit suicide. I try to hold on. I have tried. It didn't work. People belting down the door and taking me to hospital. No memory of how I got there. What made them bust down the door that evening? I didn't ask them to.

They clearly want me here. But in my selfish ways I don't want to be here. Always looking for an easy way to go. Again, even at the edge of the cliff, you look for the easy and pain free way. There is that selfish streak that has cost you and all those around you so much. Even then, the words you, and the concept of I, comes into it. Always wanting it easy. 

Living for others. I have responsibilities. I can't let people down. I do try. Take my meds. See my doctor. Talk to him. He is a good guy. I feel better when I talk to him.

I can't go back to hospital. I would lose my job and my financial situation has been wrecked by years of bipolar.  I need to keep my job but I feel this soul crushing pressure about it.  I can't keep going at this pace for ages. I love it when things are good but when things are bad I struggle and resent the responsibility. But this is what must happen. It is the byproduct of what I have done.

I have a little boy. Separated from his mum. She is a great mum. A great person. I'm sorry for what I did to her. I need to hold on for him. I do. I read articles about kids from parents with suicide. My dad died when I was young. He went in the most painful and horrific of circumstances. A skeleton in a bed at the end. I blocked it out and 25 years later it still haunts me. His parents didn't want to know me after his death. I was only 10. I never understood why? Never had it explained to me why? My mum and dad weren't married when I was born. Sure conservatives might not recognise such relationships but wouldn't it be different for their grandson? I guess not.

But see here I am talking about me and all my woes. They are just made up. I shouldn't feel like this. Every sentence starting with I. Why? 

It has to be about others. Stay in the game because they care. The ultimate selfish act is suicide. But is it in the end? Is it really in the end?

All you do is cause misery when you are alive and manic. Maybe, after the initial pain, their life would improve? I've lost my best friend. I was manic and depressed and incredibly self absorbed. Either under medicated or wrongly medicated. I was horrible. Don't deserve forgiveness. But I beg and beg. Just to show I know what I did and how I want to make it up. She says if I cared I would move on. She's right. But you see I am selfish and I keep trying to plead, beg, borrow, steal, annoy and most of all be selfish to show her that I am not the person who was out of control. I want to focus on someone else. I've pushed them all away. 

So here I sit. Always here. Just alone with nothing but my mind. My horrible mind. It wants it to end. But there is no easy way. Train. Always the option of the train. But I feel sorry for the train driver. It would be horrible and when you read stories about what they go through then I don't think I can do it to them. 

Car accident? Yeah. Just drive into a tree. Make it look like I tried to break? But I would probably just mess it up and be more fucked than I am now. And then I will become a bigger burden than I already am. 

I really do want it over deep down. The meds work. I guess. But it doesn't stop the feelings. I don't feel violent towards any others. To the outside world I try to put on a mask.

Like how I imagine attending a Venice mask party. That is my life. Constantly pretending to the outside world that all is ok. The mask. Permanently fixed until I get home and place it on my dirty and messy kitchen counter. There it rests until the next day when it gets fixed again. If I can get out the door and most morning I simply have to. Little choice. If ever I am to make it up to anyone I have to work and be financially responsible. 

The beauty of the Venice mask that once was has turned into a horrible and haunted hockey mask on the inside. Venice. at least the act of beauty to others. Inside it's like Jason from that movie Is wearing a hockey mask.

I don't know why I am writing this. I usually just send it to myself. Tap away on my iPhone. It kind of makes me feel better. Sometimes I sit in hope that my friend would just come and knock on my door. I know they won't. But that's ok. Cause that's what I deserve genuinely. 

They say it gets better. Does it? I've seen and heard the platitudes. Don't believe them anymore. Genuinely. I've always been skeptical. It works well but has its severe limitations.

Back to selfish me to finish this off. I want it to stop. Yes, there I said it. Selfish to the end but I do want it over. I stay for others of course. In some way I stay. Especially my boy. If it wasn't for him it would be easier. 

I guess that's why they make it so hard to go. There is no easy way. But sometimes and most of the time it feels like there is no easy way to live. There. To the end. Wanting it easy. 

Sorry for this note. It was just typed as a stream of consciousness. It means something to me. I don't expect it to mean anything to you. 

I won't do anything. "

I think I'm done.

I'm 40.  I pride myself on my ability to solve complex problems and i've been extremely successful doing so in my work life.  Next year I stand to make more passive income than I know what to do with and I currently have more money than I can reasonably spend.  I'm not unattractive, I am down to my college weight, I eat healthy and I exercise near daily.  i.e. I'm not overweight and gross.  In fact, I'm moderately attractive as a Spanish/Asian mix.

Every relationship I've had in my life end in ridiculous tragedy or is just plain ridiculous.  

Oddly, the problem I struggle with most is in my personal life.  I approach women on a regular basis.  I get the occasional date, yet i'm unfulfilled.  As I require a certain level of intelligence and attractiveness.  Perhaps I'm too picky.  Still, women I'm interested in, they abhor me.  

I don't believe in God.  I think we're worm food.  We exist to continue the human race and to improve it.  I work everyday to improve the lives of everyone on the planet.  Yet, I don't think I'll be in any way part of the future through my lineage.  I have no path to a lineage.   It's troubling.

I wrote a will.  A good friend of mine whom, I hope, is living well has 5 children.  I'm leaving my money and estate to them for when they grow.

I have a gun.  I think I'm going to use it.  Forever sleep sounds nice.

anime_girlfriend,5bfpyo,1478439103,over it,"i'm 21 years old and my lungs feel really bad. i'm concerned i have emphysema from smoking. everyone says ""it's probably your asthma,"" but i'm on a steroid inhaler, a pill, AND i use the rescue inhaler daily and my issue does NOT stop in the slightest. chest x-ray: no cancer.

it's just your asthma, they say, while ventolin has historically rid me of all asthmatic symptoms and now, as of 3 weeks ago, after i neared 4 years of smoking, it stops. i've quit smoking since, but it doesn't matter. my breathing felt better as a smoker prior to 3 weeks ago when this started, than it does now, after i have quit. my peak flow has consistently been 300. i'm 21. i'm fucking 21 and, as reality seems to dictate, very likely have a chronic disease of the lungs. 21 with emphysema = suicide. i can't deal with this shit for much longer. i need to breathe.

see a doctor, they say. yeah? how do you suggest i do that. my unloving, terrible excuses of parents kicked me out. i had to move states. i've been leeching off a friend for months now. no more insurance. i've been lacking motivation. some kinda issue. skitz? idk. so apathetic. i don't give a flying fuck about any of it. 2 unused gym memberships collecting debt. a simple phonecall would solve this problem. but nope, i have no desire to do that. i simply want to die.

that's not to mention my mental health. i've been having psychotic symptoms, like voices in my head, and tactile hallucinations. schizo = it's over. i don't care what you say. major depression. mania. personality disorder. if you knew what i was like, you'd want me dead. i am a sociopath. that, and someone with schiz becomes a mental retard. you all know it's true. it is a death sentence for the ""self.""

seek therapy, you say. but i have no insurance. and no therapist could save me from my REALISTIC worldview of the fact that schiz's are beyond help. load them up with meds until they are fat, stupid, undesirable shells of themselves who exist only to weigh down the people they are leeching off of for support. get mad at me for saying that. i've been hearing voices, so fuck you if you think i'm wrong.

we live in a narcissistic world. if you aren't fit for the gene pool, social groups will leave you behind. that's the painful reality of this all. human beings are still as animalistic as that which they evolved from. we're a cancer whose sole purpose is to optimize ourselves through selective reproduction. it's a painful truth nobody wants to admit.

if you are mentally or physically disabled, you are over. an outlier. big dreams get evaporated.

they tell you, ""you can still live a happy life like this.""

bullshit. it's about lowering your standards.

so, in summary, i am a mentally ill, probably schizo, 21 year old with probable lung disease, an intense level of misanthropy, to the point where i am now sympathizing with mass murderers, a broken personality thanks to abusive parents, no insurance, no way to get help because for some reason, the best our species could do is what we have now, and it's shit, mind you. fucking idiots, i have had it with human beings. we're about to have a trump presidency. it's not like a hillary one would be much better. but really, feeling highly pessimistic about our potential because of this. those two options are a failure of america. i digress.

another tl;dr because i'm really disorganized right now and am not sure what i want to accomplish by posting this. i WANT therapy. i WANT to try it. but they make it fucking impossible. 3 month long waiting lists. need insurance. shitty, ignorant health professionals. what are you supposed to do?

the answer is, not be born a disordered, undesirable piece of shit. to be born of perfect genetics. you all know it's true. don't bullshit me. none of you would fuck a burn victim. so save the sentimental crap for someone dumb enough to believe it."

Maybe I need to vent. Maybe I need a way out. When I look at the pros and cons all I really have is a supportive grandmother and my girlfriend. They're probably the only reason I haven't committed suicide yet. I guess I am weak. All the other people with problems on this SR, what makes me so special, right?

Lost my job last year and since then I have not even wanted to live my house. I was a happy child but things did not work out as planned and I am stuck at a phase where I see no future.

They can help me cheer me for a while but not all my life. I do not want to live alone but no matter what I do I end up alone. I am not a bad person but I am not sure why this all happens with me. Every night when I go to bed I pray that I never wake up and just pass out in sleep. That is if I fall asleep. Depression has taken away my sleep and given me lot of other problems.

I was Diagnosed with Specter Autism, so being social for me is naturally really hard, because of that he always said that i'm mentally incapable of doing most things.

Imustkeepsmiling,5dcaeo,1479336389,I'm losing control and my depression is winning. I'm such a coward and a burden.,"I can't control my feelings anymore, my chest feels heavy and I can hardly breath, my depression is getting the better of me and it's starting to get much worse as the thoughts of killing myself are starting to come back again after almost a year of peace. 

I should be happy ! I have friends, I have family, I have a job and I'm healthy, I even have a person that I love, whom may not love me the same way but I know cares deeply for me as we spend lots of nights together as friends and sometimes even more, but here I am, sitting in his bed as he's on the PC and I can't stopping myself from thinking : what if I just go upstairs and kill myself ? Would the other people here notice in the house? How long would it take him to notice I was gone? Would he care? Would anyone care?

I tried to run away from this feeling, I moved countries and tried new things which was great at first, but now I am back home because my depression just got worse then before.

I thought coming home would make me feel better, everyone was so happy to see me, my friends even talked about how I was the glue to the group, how everyone is so happy to have me back but here I am , thinking about all the ways I could kill myself.

I feel so terrible for feeling this way, why should I, have any right to feel depressed and sad? So many people love me that are willing to help me but I just can't, I can't speak my mind, I can't tell them, I can't disappoint them. 

Killing myself seems so easy, then everything would just be over, I wouldn't have to deal with anything , everything would just be gone. 

I'd be gone. 

Maybe I'm just a coward, a coward that should just kill herself so no one has to deal with this bullshit that goes through my head, if I kill myself I won't be a burden to anyone anymore, I won't be in the way of anyone anymore. 

I'd be the coward that finally let go and made everyone's life easier."
PM_ME_COUPLE_PICS,5ekm3i,1479944901,I'm trash and my life is trash,"To begin, I don't want to call a suicide hotline because I have in the past and they called 911 on me and had me committed. I can't afford an ambulance or hospital bill right now.

I know this is a long post, but I need to vent because I'm stressing out and don't want to put all of this onto other people I know in real life.

I am 25 years old. I have major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. I am a transgender man who was previously on hormones for about 2 years but can no longer afford to go to the doctor / get a prescription, much less surgery. I have changed my name legally. In January, I am about to be kicked off of my health insurance, which I cannot seem to get them to change my name on. Without my name on my insurance card matching my legal name, I cannot get my prescriptions.

Since changing my name also, trying to get ANYTHING approved is hell, even though I've had my social security changed as well. My background checks take forever, and if I try to do anything involving a credit check, it won't show anything.

I am living with my very poor mother in a small house that is absolutely filthy and probably breaks some numerous renter's codes. I have no privacy, and my mother is an alcoholic with an overnight work schedule. I can't even shower whenever I want to because we share one bathroom which is in her room and she sleeps during the day and yells if the sound of the shower wakes her. I feel disgusting physically.

I just got a low-paying retail job managing inventory and shipping. I have gone to one 2-hour training and one 8-hour shift so far. I am not on the schedule yet and cannot get in touch with anyone whenever I call the store to tell me what my schedule is meant to be. They made it a point to say that every person in the store will be working on Black Friday. And I can't figure out when I am supposed to work and am worried I'll get fired after working for only one day. 

Additionally, being that I am fat and have back issues, standing/walking and lifting physically destroys me after any time past 4-6 hours, much less an 8 hour shift. I mean my whole entire body aches and it's difficult to walk for the next day or two. So I don't know how I can manage in this line of work.

My work history is spotty because I've focused on education.

I have my bachelor's in psychology and am trying to get my master's in counseling, ironically. I cannot find work with my psych degree alone, it seems. I have had to take a medical leave from my grad program twice now, and I am to resume classes in January.

Things may get better in January, but I am trying to survive until then, and it's difficult. I'm worried that I cannot afford my car/phone bills, and I am going to have to start paying my own car and health insurance for the first time. I don't even know where to begin with this stuff.

I may be able to move out using my financial aid money starting in January. But I already tried moving out on my own (when I was on medical leave from school, so I had no financial aid) once and it fell through after a couple of months. I'm worried that will happen again. I have lived with an ex before for about a year and a half, but apart from that, I've always lived with family.

I feel like a loser, a failure, a bum. I feel like I can never get ahead, even though I spent so much time focusing on school.

I have a partner who loves me, but we have had our issues, revolving mainly around distance (their family lives on the other side of the country). I have a sister who loves me, but she has her own family and her own life and she is busy, and I feel like we're just going to continue growing more and more distant.

I've grown distant from all of my friends, or they've moved to another state.

I feel alone, trapped, helpless, and hopeless. For something like 2 1/2 years I've been struggling just to survive and get by, while I've had to deal with trying to get back into school. I had to resort to sex work at one point, for a few months, but it wasn't consistent work, and it made me feel dehumanized. I'm not interested in men at all physically, and it hurt a lot and was awful. But I'm terrified of having to go back to it just to survive.

I feel like I don't have the necessary life skills to make it, and I don't know what the point is in trying. I'm too much of a coward to try to kill myself in sloppy or violent ways, but I find myself thinking, ""I should have killed myself when I had the chance,"" like when I had access to a gun (I'm terrified of guns) or had access to prescription medications that I could have overdosed on.

I don't know how I'm going to possibly be able to help anyone else, if I do finish school, when I can't even help myself. I feel like my professors know that I'm incapable of making it and will kick me out of the program entirely.
If that happens, I have no future at all... I can't live like my mom working shitty retail positions and living in a cockroach infested shithole for the rest of my life.

If you read all of this, then thank you. I know it's quite long."
suicidalrisk,5aza18,1478205718,When you've been abandoned by everyone death is the only answer.,"3 years ago, my father, who I adored more than life itself, died fro a sudden deadly heart attack.

Six months after that I lost a VERY dear to me cat. She was brutally murdered. I will never get over that. My son, who I thought had mental issues, is on meth. I was running all over town, filling out applications, and BEGGING for someone to help him for his mental issues, only to find out it's meth. My daughter and I got in an argument 5 months ago and now she won't speak to me. She's borderline mentally abuse to me anyhow. The only thing left good in my life was my grandson, who I saw multiple times every day for 2 1/2 years. I love him more than anything. Since the fight with my daughter I only got to see him once a week, which was hugely devastating. Yesterday I was told they are moving a state away, and most likely I will never see any of them again. I hurt so much I can't do anything but take a lot of sleeping pills and then cry myself asleep. My parents are dead, my children don't care about me at all, and I'm in major pain everyday. I've obviously been a huge disappointment to my children, and every one around me. I tried very hard to make a good life for my children. I surrounded them with love and protection. And now I'm surrounded by nothing but pain, misery and being alone. "

LittleBlueSilly,5f2u60,1480209980,"Philosophically speaking, I should end my life.","**Warning: This post is long and autobiographical.**

Full disclosure: I have had suicidal thoughts since I was fourteen years old. I'm 25 now. Currently, I am in my second year of graduate school in a small town in rural North Carolina. I cannot drive, so I ride to campus with either my sister (who is younger than I am but much more successful) or my next-door neighbor, who is...annoying but friendly. My sister will be moving to Boston with her boyfriend next month, so I will have to fulfill the arrangements my mother and I made with the local transportation department...except that I don't know how to get them to drop me off at my condominium once I return from school. The nearest bus stop is seven-tenths of a mile away on a road with no sidewalks. I've walked that way and back before, but since I will continue to attend night classes next semester, the pedestrian path is not an option.

To make matters worse, I have squandered most of the opportunities that graduate school is supposed to provide. Before I started graduate school, I told myself, ""You're going to do things differently from your undergrad years. You'll have to make friends so you can find a job when you graduate."" I haven't done that. Instead, I spend most of my time alone, as I have always done. I have one semester left to change my ways, but I don't think that's going to happen.

In many respects, I am rather privileged. My parents own the condominium I live in, so I don't have to pay rent. This stroke of fortune automatically raises me above millions of other people, but it still doesn't keep the demons at bay. I have over $25,000 in student debt, and because I have no job prospects, I have no idea how I'm going to pay it off when I graduate next spring. The town I live in, as mentioned earlier, is very small, and job opportunities are limited. Perhaps I should mention that my MA is in English, as was my BA, for the reason that I'm not interested in anything other than literature.

Reading is all I like to do. I have no interest in learning to do anything new. Relationships bore me. Work of any kind makes me want to heave. I want to live an isolated life beholden to no one: no bosses, no friends, no family, no lovers. Anything else makes my brain snarl in fury. The very idea of finding a ""dream job"" is absurd to me. Even as a teenager, I was *good* at most of my lessons, and I *still* hated going to school. Nothing done on a schedule can be enjoyable. At most, it can be tolerated. 

In summary, the big picture is that I see no way out of a pit of financial deprivation and no incentive to try to claw out of it. No future event could possibly improve upon an eternity of quiet solitude, which is all I care about but will continue to be denied me. Death sounds like a reward. Life is a nausea-inducing roller coaster of turmoil, and I want to get off of it."

AnWaffledisaster,5f9ht3,1480304346,Rant,"I'm sorry this is long but I'm just going to rant here because my friend is mad at me because I've told her about how I feel about life.

Im a sophomore and I'm kinda introverted. I have about 3 friends/acquaintances  I talk to, but I can think back to when I was little and i used to be so outgoing. I can vividly remember in kindergarten going down to the principles office on 3 separate occasions and always talking and actually having friends and going to other people's houses and having people come over to my house. I have had 1 friend over to my house in the past 4 years. And that was because I was her ride to a event later in the day. I used to be so outgoing and when I was little my parents never really told me no, and I would do what I wanted. Around the 5th grade I came to a realization that I was a fat, too tall for my age, ugly, and overall annoyance to everyone around me. And I guess sometime around there I stoped talking to people. In 7th grade I had 1 friend and it was more like an aquaintance. In 8th grade I forced myself to talk to people and I had 4 friends. I kept most of these people as acquaintances in 9th grade but I realized here that I have no one. Now I'm in the 10th grade. My ""best friend"" is such an amazing person but her best friend told me to stop talking to my friend because everytime I would vent to her she would cry, which my best friend never told me. I've been sent to the school councelor 3 times now because of her. Now all we do is snapchat a few times a day to keep our streak and it hurts because she will never snapchat me first. She doesn't care about me anymore I must of pushed her away because she doesn't even want to talk to me I need to stop snapchatting her. Back when I used to talk to her about things she would tell me before that i just need time to figure things out and that everything will work out and that if I killed myself my family and ""friends"" will be devastated. 

Well. I'm tired and I'm sad. I'm a pathetic human being. My family might be sad but honestly they should've seen it coming. My ""friends"", they will be fine. None of them even knew me anyways I never hung out with them. I hate my body, I wish I was short and not 6 feet tall, I wish that I wasn't a size 12 in shoes, and I wish I wouldn't have to buy everything in large because of my height. im never going to amount to anything. I'll never have real friends. 

If I kill myself (which would not be tonight) I wouldn't have to deal with anything or anyone and I could just be done. I will kill myself eventually. If it's not in high school then it will be in college. 

I miss talking to my friend. But I cant upset her anymore. "
schmoopy555,5ah0dz,1477970984,Not even my own family believes in me,"So I've had severe depression for most, if not, all of my life. It has deeply impacted the way I see the world, confirmed to me there is no god, confirmed to me that I'm nothing but a miserable, insignificant sack of shit, and that this world is a horrible place to live in. I can't maintain a social life, and every common failure I have is blown far out of proportion. I also have social anxiety disorder, which pretty much fucks over any chance at being happy. I've been overweight, ugly, and not given any respect all my life. I've tried to kill myself on multiple occasions, and only stopped because I'm too much of a coward. My sister left for college, and life has been shit ever since. She was the only member of our family that was actually optimistic, and sort of held us together. Without her, life is even more void than usual. The only other people at home are my clincaly diagnosed mentally insane mother, and my severely depressed father. I'm currently a senior in high school, and I'm currently applying to colleges. I don't do any sports, or do anything that makes me great. Today, I think i'm gonna kill myself for real. My dad got me another expensive college counselor, and today, I wanted to tell him that I thought I knew how to finish the rest of the progress, and that he should stop paying money for something I can do myself. I told him that  I thought I could do it. And the one person in my life who I try to prove myself to said ""No, you can't. That's why I hired someone to do it for you."" That blow hit me so hard. It confirmed that even my own father views me as a failure, and that I can't even apply to colleges correctly. I have a knife and plan on slitting my throat."

I am 15 and have been dealing with these issues since sixth grade. They have only worsened since they started. I have had crap in my life, but it is better now. I should feel better, but I don't.

icyvoidofhope,5dk5u9,1479437936,I have body image issue so severe I'm moments away from shooting myself.,"I'm a 24 year old male. I have a 4 inch penis. I've been rejected for my size 4 times. I've spoken with female friends about size and they all say bigger is better and laugh at smaller ones because they assume I'm well endowed.

Females in my family, including my mother, have spoken in a derogatory manner about small men. In fact, one of the most frequent insults I've heard my mother use is saying that a man that was rude or ok n a power trip ""must have a little dick"". 

But I always had hope I'd grow. I never saw another man's penis and I just assumed I'd grow as I got older. Especially since, when I raised this concern witb my mom when I was a kid, she assured me my biological father was well endowed (he abandoned us) and that I just needed to be patient. I also saw my grandfather and two uncles during my teenage years (changing for a funeral in the same room) and they were all extremely well endowed so I got excited that I would be eventually as well. But I'm 24 years old and I'm 4 inches. I can't go through life like this. Maybe some guys can and good for them but I'm burnt out. 

Years went by and I just never had any remarkable growth. I still thought I'd grow though. Recently, I graduated college and I've been having such a hard time finding a job I moved back home and got a job at a local car dealership. There's tons of cool people that work there, too and I do enjoy my coworkers and the job. 

Recently we went to a bar and we're all talking, while most of us were drunk, about sex. Now I don't drink. I just don't have any desire to drink and alcohol tastes bad to me. And I'm a virgin so I tend to just calm up when the topic of sex arises because I literally have nothing to contribute except for my rejections. 

There's a girl that was there who's been really flirty with me and her being drunk only made her flirting more obvious. Anyway, during this little get together she began talking about how ""a big dick is a must"" and what's more crushing for me is that all the females there, even the damn server, agreed with her. Sure they laughed and said technique is more important, but when pressed they all agreed there's really no substitute for size and technique.

I wanted to cry and run away. But I didny. I sat t here and acted like I was on my phone. I listened to all the contempt they levied at small men and I just fell to pieces on the inside. It felt like an eternity and I wanted to explode. 

After a while we finally paid and we're leaving and I was damn near running to my car when the girl who's been flirty with me, and that I admittedly liked, caught up to me and asked if I wanted to come to her place. I was so mad and hurt and desperate to get home I just said no and walked away and drove home.

I've been here for the past two days. I called off work and I've been weeping and researching online. I read countless examples of women assuring men that size didn't matter. Then I found reddit and then I found a few sub reddit that brought me to this point.

Ladyboners, massivecock, bigdickproblems, and bigdickjoy.

I read through those subs. I read what the women, in particular had to say. And the final blow was a woman who had seen a picture of a guys big penis and got excited and said something along the lines of, ""lol and I tell small guys size doesn't matter"".

I feel cheated and screwed over by genetics. I wish I'd never been born at all and I'm all but ready to shoot myself. I don't want to go through life like this. 

I just needed to type this out before I did it. Maybe there's hope for me that you can share. I actually doubt there is but I wouldn't know unless I tried posting. One last thing, please don't give me platitudes about motion and fingers and oral and toys and ""it's not the dick, it's the guy attached to the dick"". I've seen and heard for too many examples for me to accept any of that as I know it simply isn't true.

If that's all there is for me in the way of hope, then I'm punching my ticket."
lostghostgirl,5fgfcc,1480391171,Thank you,"Hi all, 

I've made a few posts here these past few days as I've been going through a hard time. Feeling disconnected, not like myself, not getting my work done, feeling lazy, like no one cares, and like I don't matter. I have been having thoughts this week, and it has been scary. 

A year ago I attempted suicide. Nothing happened, as I did a poor job guessing at how many pills to swallow. Nonetheless I survived when I really thought I wouldn't. After that, I never wanted to think about it again. I was determined to move on. 

It was harder than I thought. I still struggled with anxiety and depression, and I kept it all to myself. Only 3 people know of my attempt, and that's a lot more people than I wanted to to know. I even went to a therapist, but said nothing of suicide or thoughts of self harm out of fear, so not sure why I even went in the first place. 

The dark cloud has come back swinging this week, and most of all I feel bad because I did it to myself. Things are going so great in my life- Things have literally never been this great, ever. I shouldn't have any complaints. Yet I want to die. I don't know why I've come into this again- but I am glad I have found this community on Reddit so I don't feel so alone. 

Here's to hoping I make it this week, and to hoping people who are feeling similar find a different path to take as well. 

~Hugs~"

Tethered to this earthly plane, how fragile are the ties that bind. Like silk ribbons, present, for decorative design, for observation.

lemonbee8,5e2vgn,1479713551,will it ever get better?,"Do you ever just think about the fact that some people never have to deal with this stuff? Like they never have depression or suicidal thoughts.  

I can't imagine living like that. All I've ever known is this endless cycle of sadness to numbness and back again. Sometimes i can get a break for a few fleeting moments of something else, but i dont know if id call it happiness.

the only thing i look forward to is getting drunk or high. luckily there is no shortage of drugs for me to fill up on. although now im starting to feel the hangovers pretty bad, and the highs aren't as good as they used to be. but its still better than feeling nothing. id rather be in pain than feel nothing anymore.

 i used to look forward to hanging out with my boyfriend or other friends but they all left in july and i havent had anyone since. im so alone. but i dont have the engery to start new relationships. i can't do it anymore. i can't burden others with my problems anymore. i have nothing left to give. im just an empty body animated by the chemicals the doctors and i pump in. 

I'm so tired. i dont want to try anymore.  i just dont want to exist anymore.

qill,5byws3,1478670916,Tired of fighting obsessive thoughts,"I won't go into my whole sob story because ultimately that's all it is- a sad story. Everyone has a sad story. But more recently things are bad enough that I think about suicide constantly. I fantasize about it. The things I wanted in life kept getting farther and father away, and I've had to come to terms with the fact that now I can never have them. And that's hard. I don't want to believe it but I don't have a choice, except the choosing if I really want to continue on knowing I'll never have the life I wanted.

It's consuming my life and all I think about. I also keep thinking about how I have no friends, no relationships, no close familial ties. Only about three people know I am alive and they are all immediate family. I'm not so jaded that I don't think the very few handful of people who still consider me a friend wouldn't care- they might be sad. But they are all very far away and so distant that it would pass, it wouldn't affect them all that much. 

Everything just seems to be pointing towards it being the right time. No attatchments to others. No obligations, work-wise or other. Nobody relying on me. Declining health, missed opportunities. If just seems like the right time and if nothing else I'd be free of thinking about it every minute of every day.

I don't know why I'm sharing this or what I'm asking for. I feel like I have no hope left of anything getting better. I don't know why I feel compelled to tell anyone because it shouldn't matter. But I do."

bubbbuka,5fh8s8,1480402281,I think it is too late,"I am sorry in advance for my bad english. It is not my first language.


I read many topics here before starting mine and I don't mean to offend anyone but most problems really seem weird to me. Definitely not worth killing yourself over them. I have never thought about suicide since middle school and I am 24 yo now, and my life is and has always been a total mess. I moved to USA 4 months ago and I thought ""Ok, now it's my chance to wipe the state clean""  and I guess I was wrong. 


I have spent last 4 years of my life back in my country playing PC games. When I say ""spent"" I mean that I spent 12+ hours every single day. I even only chose to worke 1 24 hour day then 3 days off schedule, that way I could play games more than usual 5/2 8 hour working schedule. Or I didnt work at all, I think I worked less than a year(in sum) of those 4 years. My usual day was : get up, eat something while watching some tv show, play games, eat somethng while watching tv show, play games, browse 4chan/reddit, go to sleep. Oh, I also went to gym semi-regularly.  I didn't have any friends, I rarely talked to parents so that really what my days consisted of, all of them. 

I used to go to university before, but then I applied for moving to USA and there was no sense in finishing my degree and I thought, ""well I ll just wait 2 years"". That process took longer than I expected and 2 years became 4. When I moved here I stopped playing games and I really tried to start over. I started reading a lot, I used to read so much back in school and probably that made me thinking. I really am fucked up. I should be on some heavy medication, pills or something like that. Ever since I remember myself I was always not like others, I was worse and then those 4 years turned me into complete garbage. 

I remembered so many things about my childhood and school that I thought I forgot long time ago. I have never had any friends. Never. I had some guys I occassionally talked to, you know, shake hands, say Hi etc. When we had parties, everyone was invited but me. When people hung out after school, I have never been there. When most of guys came in, they shake hands as greetings, most of them didnt give their hand to me. In my country girls kiss guys in cheek as a greeting. It never happened to me. I remember moments when there were like all guys sitting waiting for class and we were like in queue, girls come and kiss everyone in cheek, everyone but me. They just stopped and turned back on me. During class I always sat alone.  When we had class trips, I could never find a partner for myself to share room with. And funny thing is that I changed 4 schools before college and in at least 3 of them(I just don't remember 1st) it was like that. Why? I really don't understand it. What have I done wrong? I have never been bullied or anything like that, just total ignore from everyone in all schools. I must have done something to bring it on myself. I remember in middle school I wasn't introverted type for sure, I tried to play with others and stuff like that but I still was never invited to anyone's home, never been to anyone's birthday party. I remember 1 party we had when I was in a camp. There was a game when you spin a bottle and the one spinning the bottle kisses the one who the bottle shows when it ends it's spin. Everyone got kissed, but me of course. The girl just said like ""noway"", everyone laughed and I wished I could become invisible that moment haha. And I wasn't ugly or some creep, I asked my mom for my school photos, I looked average.  I think I went into too much details. Anyways, my point was, that ever since I remember myself I have always been an outsider, outcast ignored by others.


When I got expelled from my second school, I started talking about sucide, what's the point of life blabla and my parents made me visit literally dozens of shrinks for years until university. I can't say that any of them were of any use but one of them did something very important. She made me forget about suicide by creating what I called ""walls"". She made me practically never to think about bad things in my life by creating imaginary walls. It is very hard to explain how does it work. Basically, whenever I had bad thoughts I could just make them go away by simply making a wall in my mind, putting it behind it and then forget about it. It's kinda hard to believe, but I learned to do it automatically and whenever I had bad thoughts I just did it and got rid of it. I think it is one of the main problems of my life, if not the main. It for sure is the main reason I turned into what I am now. Whenever during those 4 years I thought ""what are you doing"" ""is that what your life supposed to be"" etc, I always could say ""fuck it"" and keep playing games. Simple.


It's becoming too long, so I ll just write what else cool perks do I have.


I got OCD. It used to be so much worse back in my country, I literally could wash my hands every 10 minutes I am at PC because I always thought that my hands were sweaty and I would play worse because of it and I need to wash hands to get better luck etc. I have obession with numbers. 2 and 6 are bad numbers. 26 and 62 are the numbers I should always avoid. 3 and 7 are good ones. Hard to explain, but I will just give few examples: I can never stop reading book on page that has ""2"" or ""6"" in the end of it, I can never stop youtube video on same ""2"" and ""6"" if it's in minute or video. Whenever I watch tv show or anime episode, I can never stop on 2nd or 6th. I can never eat 2 something, it must be either 1 or 3. When I talk to someone over the phone, the phone call ends and I see that we talked 6 minutes, I call back and make any excuse to talk 1 more minute, because 6 is bad omen. It became less painful here, it's easier to control. If I have something important in my life going on, especially not depending on me, then I turn into complete wreck and ocd becomes huge part of my life. I have things that I tell myself I have to do or that important thing will go bad. If I don't step that special way or if I don't pet my cat for 10 minutes straight or If I don't do this or that, so many thougts. The weeks I have been waiting for USA embassy's decision were a total nightmare. Or days here when I waited for college tests' results. 


I said I go to gym. Originally I wanted to go to gym to have a cool body, to change myself etc. I managed to turn that idea into total garbage. There are ""diet"" and ""bulking"" for most people that go to gym. I managed to pervert the idea of it and now I think I have some kind of eating disorder. Last 2 years my diet consisted of dropping weight for 2-3 months on 1300-1500-1800 calorie diet depending on phase which is normal then my bulking consisted of eating 5-6k calories of snickers, twix, M&amp;Ms, pizzas, hamburgers, chips for 3-4 months. I ONLY eat junk-food and drink protein powders as a source of protein. Every time after diet I tell myself that it's the last time I eat shit and after next diet I will stop it and after next diet I make 1000 excuses and say ""next time"". I don't even have any pleasure eating junk food, it gets boring and it tastes same way chicken tastes on diet, but I keep eating it. It is unhealthy and I already got health problems of it, looking forward for my 30s to have no teeth, sugar diabeties and stuff like that.

I can't have girlfriends. I had one that was really ""ideal"" for me and I can't believe how lucky I was to have her but I fucked up that so horribly that I don't even want to write about that. I can just say that it didn't work out with her and I for sure know it won't work out with others. Please just trust me here on my word.

My memory. I used to be very clever or at least I like to think so. I read so much, I knew so much about history, religion, politics and psychology, I generally had vast outlook, I knew about a lot of things and was interested of them. I used to know 2 other languages, I have studied them for 7 and 9 years and I can't say 2 words in them now. I don't remember anything of what I read, I can barely even remember movies I watched. I was so obsessed with history, I knew more than my history teachers, much more and now I can't even remember 90% of king's names, important events and all that stuff I read. I know that our memory erases stuff we don't use but there must be limit. I really forgot everything. I am stupid now. Whenever people around me talk about anything, I am often surprised how much do they know and it's really horrific when I understand that there are topics that I knew so much about, that i was a real expert in and now I dont know a single thing. I kinda blame games for that.

I don't think I should mention that I can't normally talk to most of the people, especially now with language barrier. I don't even need to go into details. Social anxiety, social phobia, blabla, that stuff.

I think that my second most important problem besides ""walls"" was my obsession with my comfort-zone and I tried my best to get rid of it here. Whenever I had an opportunity to leave house or my relatives asked me to go somewhere with them I would always say ""yes"" and I would generally try to spend as little time near PC as possible and do things that I don't want to do because I found them uncomfortable. Like asking people at the shop when I  need to. Asking other students at college when I need to or even tryng to talk to them, forcing myself to ask them some questions or begin a dialogue or smile and say HI to random strangers on a street etc. Basically whenever I thought I needed or wanted to do something but felt that I d be uncomfortable, I d tell myself that uncomfortable is good and forced myself to do it anyway. Cool idea, too bad it never worked out. I could force myself to do so, but 4 months passed and it only lead to more problems and bad thoughts. Too late for that, I should have done it in school.

These are the problems that first come to mind and wall of text is already too big so I ll just conclude it. I think that here, when I stopped playing games, I had time to think and understand that all that stuff just can't be changed that easy. It goes to deep into childhood, I have never been and will never be normal member of society. All those wet dreams about my life becoming normal once I move were just dreams. It is really funny, I don't want to go into details but I can say that the chance of me actually getting into usa was SO LOW that during those 4 years I even stopped believing in it, I just used it as the way to proscrastinate, the official success rate was lower than 15% and the cases of those who succeeded were much better than mine. Better by far. Here I am now, dream came true, now what? Now yesterday me and my relatives went to fair of new year trees and everyone was happy and stuff and I was googling on my phone best places to off yourself. I think the best way would be to jump of a tall building. I read that San-Francisco bridge is one of the places where most people in USA kill themselves. Would be cool, but there are always policemen riding around and trying to talk you out of it. Couldn't find any places like that in my city. My mother will feel bad if I kill myself. She really thinks that I changed here, went to college, stopped playing games and that I will become a normal person. I can't imagine what will she feel once she finds out I killed myself. She would go insane or have heart attack or something like that, she always said that she lives only for her children. But that really looks like the only reason to not do it. I am not sure that I should just live because of it.  I am a selfish person, a bad person and I have put her through so much shit that pretending like after all that I still care is just hypocricy.  When I say that I am a bad person, that's not badmouthing myself, that's just fact. My only friend stopped talking to me after I told him some facts about me and called me ""human garbage"" and ended our friendship. I have known him for 5 years and I have considered him really close. A person is judged by it's actions and and if there is any hell in afterlife, that's where im going. Too bad from what I read our brain just dies and it will be eternal sleep with no dreams. I really wanted to believe in reincarnation, maybe I would have better life in my second try.

I think what I wrote was just splitting my mind out, I heard it helps, and I have to go sleep, its 1.42 here, I can't wait until it's 2 or I'd have to wait another hour until 3 haha. Please, I beg you, do not write here stuff like ""please don't kill yourself"" ""you are a good person"" ""things will go better"" etc. They won't. All my life, especially those last 4 years I have been hoping that it will be better, for some reason, something will somehow change my life and it will all be good. You read these stories, you watch movies, animes, play games and you often see how people's life change. Something occurs in their life and it all becomes good. I often cried when i watched some comedies because I knew It would never happen to me. I could see that I am missing so much in my life, all the joy, all the girls, friends, parties, adventures, all these new cool experiences, I have never had it and will never have. That's fucking sad and really made me cry. I was eating tears half of the time I wrote this wall of text too. 24yo big guy crying in his aunt's basement. Nice new life."

Goat-Scream,5dei9t,1479366209,"Losing my home, losing my fiancé, losing my mind","
It's funny, never thought I'd end up chatting about my thoughts to strangers on a website I frequent daily. Things are not going quite as planned, they never do, when it rains it pours they say. Im a 23 male who lives in the PNW, I have not been able to attend school due to the riots in Portland, and am now behind. I know I'll catch up. It will be hard, but nothing worth achieving is ever easy. I'm confident in myself, confident in my abilities, and confident I want to blow my fucking brains out! Not a day goes by, where I don't wonder about how much easier things would be, but to inflict that upon my dwindling loved ones would be fucked up. That doesn't stop the thoughts though. I all to often will imagine vivid ways to end it. Very creative infact! I have all the support I could ever need, a loving fiancé, a loving mother &amp; father, a loving brother, a roof over my head, but still. Nothing. Nothing gets rid of these thoughts. 

I have spent the better part of five years talking to various therapists, doctors, professionals in the theraputic field. Four and a half of those years I was on every anti-depressant under the sun. Got to the point I was working not for a paycheck, but instead just to pay for all my doctor approved drugs! For the small price of $300 you to could feel like a zombie! Your thoughts will continue, but don't you worry about having any motivation on following through..... on anything! In may of this year I said fuck it, and stopped taking all my meds, quit my job, and smoked a shitload of weed. I found peace.... eventually. From June-August it was hell on earth. Not a day would go by as I faced my demons by the handful. My fiancé was raped three years ago, I abandoned her, and shamed her for what had happend. ""If we just goto the police, we can end all of this!"". She never wanted to goto the police, for she has had bad experiences with them when she was younger, and just wanted to pretend like it never happend. I wanted this sick piece of shits head, but would settle for the police to take him off the streets as I know violence is never the answer, unless it is. Only recently, four months ago, have I forgiven myself, and asked for forgiveness from my partner. At times I believe if God exists on earth, God has taken the form of my fiancé. Yet the thoughts are still there. Hiding. Growing. Ruining my mind. 

My father is an alcoholic, and at the ripe old age of 50 it finally caught up to him. Liver cancer. I will never forget the day he told me ""I am ready to die"". Who the fuck tells their 13 year old son that? There I was questioning whether my boner was going to send me to hell, and I now have this put on my plate?! Tried killing myself shortly after, didn't tie the rope well enough and it came loose. Then spent the next ten years questioning my thoughts, questioning those around me, and just having a very grime outlook on life. Here I am now. I love my father with all of my essence, and like a cruel twist of faith I came to this conclusion only two weeks ago. His birthday was this past monday, tuesday he got the call it is cancer, wednesday here we are. 

I have no intentions of harming myself or those around me. I have learned to turn any hate I have inward, and made myself suffer. Then I started school again, and one of the important things is learning to ground yourself, and keep your focus centered on the client. School has been... mixed. A LOT of open-minded practices happen here, and through some of these practices I have found peace for my mind, body, and soul. 

Now I learn my fiancé has been losing her mind over supporting us both while we goto school, and it is time I get a job to help support myself and her. I want to work, I want to earn money, I don't want to be a burden on anyone anymore. Here is why I am posting this. The thoughts are back. They are strong as ever. I feel like I can handle these if things were to remain the same, but with my father's failing health, losing my home, learning my partner is losing her mind, and now learning quite a few people are upset with me. I don't know what to do. 

Death is something I have become fasinated with. We hear theories on what will happen when we die, but only the dead know what lies on the other side.

I want to say I don't fear death, but instead the pain I may experience, and the loss my loved ones will face. 

I come here to simply say my tale, and hope someone, anyone, will take the time to understand me. 

I don't have the best social skills, and as a result I try to censor everything I say. I worked retail for five years of my life, and I simply cannot handle the general population in that setting. The amount of times I was told to ""smile, it will make you not look so ugly"" or ""you will never amount to anything other than boxing my shit"" was staggering. I loved everything about the job, but the customers had to go and ruin things for me. I tried killing myself several times throughout those five years, but never quite followed through. Now, with me being unemployed for 6ish months, I find myself facing all of these dark thoughts once again as it is dire I find a job. My schooling is monday, wednesday, friday, and in 13.5 months I will graduate, and I will be making enough to support myself, my fiancé, hell even a friend in need if I needed to just that. The only issue is getting through these 13.5 months. 

I need a job, but get terrified it will be a repeat of before, and then psych myself out. I spoke with the state about benefits, but was told I am overqualified for food stamps and the such. That said the very nice lady deviated from the standard social worker script, and asked what was going on. She recommended I checkout disability, as the way she said, ""you could really benefit from this it sounds"". 

Here I am now. The solution within my grasp. Yet I don't know what to do. My mind tells me to run into the forest, and end this miserable existence, but this would solve nothing. Yeah, my problems would be handled, but I would be unleashing a multitude of issues for everyone else. I refuse to do that. Yet it sounds so tempting. I have tried calling the suicide hotlines, but find my communication skills to be lacking in speech. I am working on improving this with a therapist at the school, she is aware of my suicide attempts, and has been helping me find peace.

I come to whoever has read this all the way to this point. What do I do? I am scared of every outcome, but know I need to act. I am scared if I work, I will relapse to bad habits, and I am scared if I go for disability I'll be labeled as disabled, and close doors in my life I wish not to close. The only thing I am not scared of is suicide, as I have known this handsome devil all to well. Thank you for reading.

LifesAPrison,5ebewr,1479830199,"I got almost everything to succeed yet I failed, and about to fail again.","Male, 21 years old, English is not my native language so sorry in advance for any weird mistakes.

In my 21 years of being alive I have never been happier. I finally accepted that I want to be the one who ends my life and it feels like I dropped a huge weight. Only once I have ever felt like this before and it was when I finally came to terms with the fact that the only girl I have ever liked will never feel the same about me, I found myself smiling like an idiot the whole day, just like now. 
Why I want to finally end it? Because my whole life’s been a lie. Always, since I was little, I have been praised by teachers and friends about how intelligent, how responsible, how caring and good of a person I am. My whole family has always placed me on a pedestal, to the point my sister used to hate me for always being the favorite. Now, in college, missing every class I can, ignoring group projects, studying at the last possible second and just throwing every chance I’ve been given to the trash I realize that I am a joke. I am a lazy piece of shit, whenever I decide that I want to start something I always work hard at the beginning and then just give up before finishing, I am just like my father and I hate it. I hate myself for not having the willpower to keep going, for throwing the towel at the first sign of problems. I used to think that I was invincible, that nothing could brake me, and now I laugh at my own stupidity as I have decided to take what many consider the selfish/cowards path. Everything fell apart after I failed math the first time, I had never failed any subject in my life, I could sense the disapproval hiding behind comments like “don’t worry, it happens to everybody” or “you can always try again”, now I get so stressed during classes that I feel like my heart is about to burst, I feel like I am wasting my time in class instead of studying on my own and when I try to learn by myself I just waste my time doing anything else, making me feel even more desperate because I wasted my time. I feel trapped in an endless cycle where I don’t have the willpower to break it.

 How can I expect to survive in the future like this? People only care about you as long as you are successful and/or can manipulate you. I used to be friendly with everyone, but now I realize I was naïve, people only want to use you for as long as they can, when they find no value on you they won’t care anymore and you will never hear of them again, now I rather be alone than with all my fake friends from high school. They don’t care about me, they never talk to me and never invite me to anything. I am the one who has to awkwardly show up and fortunately I am in the same wassap group as them, otherwise I would never know any of their plans because, even before, they would have never told me, sometimes they even make plans behind my back where everyone goes. They couldn’t care less if I show up or not, they just want to get wasted whenever they can, fuck me for not liking alcohol (thanks dad, you fucking ruined it with your drunken scenes). Fuck all those times I invited them to my house, fuck all the gifts I ever gave, fuck all the efforts I ever did, even my best friend prefers to hang out with some pothead instead of me because he offers him the weed he grows in his room, fuck me for even caring for so long, I hate myself for not realizing sooner that, in this world, we are all alone against whatever life throws at us and even if you succeed, life will just find a way to fuck everything up.  
I feel like shit for feeling this way, I have no right. I live with my mother and my sister comes to visit us often, we have every basic need covered and I can afford my studies thanks to the government. I feel so privileged in comparison to many here, but I just can’t help it. Last semester I broke the perfect image everyone had of me, and now am about to shatter it. Everyone will see the piece of shit I am, am not ashamed of that, I am ashamed of letting everyone down. My mother and sister always have had hope in me, they both have sacrificed a lot to bring me to where I am, and how I repay them? It saddens me to no end when I think about how highly they think of me, when in reality am just a failure, a waste of time and money. Even when other say that it’s ok to fail from time to time I can still see in the eyes the disapproval, the hope they had in me broken, and sometimes even their inside laughter.

The only person I am worried about is my mother, I love her, she will be devastated when she finds out. My sister will initially be sad but eventually will move on (she is a tough girl), and my dad? Who cares, he has always cared about money in the first place with the excuse that it is for us while wasting it on expensive trips with his girlfriend. I hope my mother can forgive me.

I haven’t decided when am going to do it, since the method I have chosen is the classic bullet to the head. To add to the list of failures I am also a coward, I am scared of changing my mind while I hang myself (plus I don’t have anywhere in the house to do it anyways) and I don’t wanna risk it with an overdose because of the chance of going to a vegetative state instead of actually dying. I am pathetic, I am even scared of failing in taking my own life. The only way to make sure is to get the biggest gun I can find and just pull the trigger, too bad it’s fucking difficult to find a real gun in my country, but I am already searching in the web for local stores. A gun, one of the things I once feared and disgusted me for what it could do is now the key I crave for my freedom, it’s almost poetic.

I thank you for reading this, I don’t really know why I wrote this in the first place, I suppose I just wanted to take it out of my chest. I won't blame you if you consider this post a waste of time, I got everything to succeed and yet I failed, and it is my own fault, even I have troubles trying to justify how I feel, everything is my fault and I deserve it.

As ridiculous as it sounds, the idea of just ending it all has given me some sort of twisted hope, no matter how bad it gets I can always just finish it (giving up, why am I not surprised?) I just need to find my key.

I'm already really suicidal and this just made it worse. I'm visiting family but im selfish and I cant take it anymore. Im going to kill myself "
ShermanTheDauphin,5fowug,1480501551,I might kill myself soon,"I want to kill myself. I haven't revised in days for tests coming up in the next few days and I know that because of that I'm gonna get bad grades and disappoint my parents and my teachers and that's the last thing I want.

For the past few years I've tried to make people happy. I've tried to help others and be empathetic and kind, but it never works out. I always end up making stupid mistakes or being awkward so my feelings don't get expressed or just plain being a terrible person. It's like I'm fated to be a bad person and I just can't take it.

I hurt my parents and my friends so much after they found out about my self-harming, which I did because I was so upset after my grandpa's death, a fall-out with a close friend and confusion about my gender and sexuality. The loss of that friendship and the self-harm scars that followed still haunt me months later and I don't think they're ever going away. I'm damaged goods and I haven't even suffered that much: I just don't have the mental strength to suck it up and get on with it.
(this is what I mean - my thought processes and worries are inherently selfish)

I had my first ever panic attack today and that's another reason I want to do this. It's proof that I can't manage my own feelings properly and it's proof that despite medication, support from family and friends and a wonderful therapist, I can't deal with this stuff. I can't deal with the workload of school (even though so many other people can), I can't deal with the self-loathing and I can't deal with the guilt. I'm statistically unlikely to change the world or really do anything useful with my life, so what's the point? Of grades, of sticking around, of living? Dying seems so peaceful right now.

I want to kill myself in the next few days, after I get my tests done and sort out unfinished business. I don't see why I shouldn't. It seems like life is just a waste of time."

Ended up leaving college for a year, worked for a bit, realized I would kill myself if I stayed in a dead end job, so I went back to school.  Now my living situation is a lot better, but I'm still recovering from this severe depression. 

 I've almost graduated, but I'm having a few problems with scheduling what I need and I'm scared because I cannot afford much more of this.  I have a lot of guilt with my family financially supporting me (which is a kind thing, but I literally told my parents I don't think I'm worth it), and I feel like there is no career path for me that will get me out of debt.  I'm super anxious about the future, I had a difficult time not telling my adviser that I see myself dead in the next 5 years. 

 I'm just tired of being repeatedly pulled down every other month in depression and having to pull myself out. I'm afraid that once I live on my own it'll be way too easy to off myself.  I've done counseling, but that doesn't really help me as much.  What helps me the most is activity, but it's extremely difficult to do things when I'm drained.

It started with getting thrown out of my house halfway through my senior year of highschool and living in my car. I stopped going to school and got my GED. I was on and off of people's couches but spending most nights in my car. I tried to go to community college but they signed me up for classes I didn't sign up for and I had to pay for those too and I only went for a semester and I have 32 credits of academic failures so I'll never get into another college. Then in January I got a speeding ticket for going 5 over on the highway and since I hadn't had my license for two years yet my license was suspended for 30 days but I didn't have an address so I was never notified and continued driving. I was pulled over and my license was suspended another 6 months (this time I knew so I didn't drive) so I've been living in my car in the woods and spending the night sometimes on people's couch. I get my license back on Thursday but now my car is broken and I don't have the money to fix it and winter is coming which I won't survive without being able to drive my car south. I have no place to live, no money, no future, no friends, no family and I don't see a point to being alive anymore. Idk why I'm posting... I guess to to see if anyone has anything to say to give me hope for the future."

My old friends don't care about me, my family doesn't even exist anymore, so what the fuck am I supposed to do? It's become too much for any sane person to deal with. Far too much. No one will talk to me. No one. "
discurraged,5ewoy3,1480119210,Living for Others,"Hello. I'm 21 and for as long as I can remember, I have never particularly wanted to be alive. If you asked 8 year old me if I wanted to live, and I answered honestly, I would've told you no. 

I have been through all of the traditional methods to try to rectify the failings of my brain chemistry. Dozens of doctors, psychiatrists, prescriptions, and a stay in the psych ward. I've run out of any faith I had in the way our medical system handles mental illness. 

I am (mildly) paranoid schizophrenic, (rapid cycling) bipolar, and have borderline personality disorder. These disorders make it incredibly hard to hold down a job. I have been living with my parents and serving no purpose for a couple years, due to losing my car in an accident and therefore my job. 

I received only several thousand dollars in compensation from that accident after eighteen months of waiting and spent all of it on garbage in three weeks, with nothing to show for it. It was enough to buy a crappy used car or even take a vacation, as I wanted to do both of those things.

I feel like I know what I have to do to 'get better,' but frankly, I have no interest in doing any of it at all. It seems I would have to 'fake it until I make it' and that thought disgusts me. I know what a 'success' looks like in our society and I want literally nothing to do with the way we have framed achievements and what we consider to be valuable pursuits. I hated myself as a lying (read: bullshitting) salesman, as a meek middle manager, as a cashier, as a cook. I've only ever enjoyed one job, washing dishes, because I saw no way to do anything immoral or disagreeable. All I could do was make things more clean and make people more safe. 

 I have never wanted children, and don't really believe in monogamy. I will never feel free to 'be who I am' because 'who I am' was stomped out of me during my upbringing. I would've probably been a much happier person if I were allowed to embrace traits like sensitivity, compassion and kindness, but my father was always an angry, conservative, stern man. He made a great effort to impart a very vague, fluid system of morals that I am to obey. He made himself into something of a god figure to me and my sibling. I feel that both my sibling and I have crafted our personalities to keep us safe from our father's rage and contempt. It was almost like if we were to act against his word, we would be sent to hell. And in many ways, I think we both still have that feeling as adults.

His father, my grandfather, killed himself two months ago. He was depressed and suicidal for a long time and the last thing my dad said to him was to go ahead and do it but not to leave him a mess. Obviously there is more nuance to this situation, but the facts remain. Both of my parents have justified this by saying that my father tried to help his father many times, and it was okay for him to die because of his advanced age and deteriorative state. I am no expert in philosophy but this reasoning does not compute in my mind. You either believe someone has a right to their life or you don't. 

It is apparent to me that our lives are only considered important when we are valuable to each other. Our worth is measured by our ability to produce for each other and the State, and our ability to create and raise more children to do the same. It is because of this that the only way I am to be happily assimilated into society is if I start treating myself like capital and considering others for their transactional value and not as thoughtful humans with their own wants and needs. 

I feel that the only reason I stay alive is to satisfy my family. To deliver them from suffering. I have told them this a few times, not to threaten or upset them, but rather to be candid and truthful. After an argument with my father last week, he told me to pack my things, which is understandable due to my age and demeanor. I am appreciative of the support and sympathy they were able to give me for as long as they have, but I must admit that I find their desire to keep me alive rather selfish. Not that this is a bad thing, I simply find it ironic to be called selfish and a martyr so often by my father because of this. He is a toxic man and perhaps it will serve me well to get away from him but I think it may be too late for my psyche. I've spent my whole life mentally enslaved to him, the only way to repair something like that is to instill yet another delusion. 

He bought me a ticket back to my hometown at the end of this month, thousands of miles away, where my sibling still lives. My mother called my sibling, who called me, crying and begging me not to 'leave them' by ending my life. They offered me a place to live for the time being. 

In the last few days, we have spoken every day, and they are doing everything they can to help me get set up, find a job, etc., and I am entirely discouraged but back to pretending like I really want to do this, 'getting better' and 'being productive.' I think this is because of my Borderline Personality Disorder... I'm likely to reflect whatever energy you throw at me. But the reality of it is that I'm still entirely uninterested in any of this.

I also have several thousand dollars in debt. My credit score was in the mid 400's last I checked. The offer of a living situation from my sibling is only temporary and I do not see a way to get into a better financial situation to move out, much less that and 'get healthy' at the same time. My sibling has an SO that they are obviously very happy about and I hate that I inevitably be in the way of their relationship for even a short period of time. 

I have no skills, no education. I have applied for over 100 jobs in my current city and had only one interview that I have had several bad dreams about, it went so poorly. 

I will move in with my sibling and try to get a job. I don't have any money or transportation, and I don't believe that I'll be able to hold a job down if I can even get one. I'll give it a shot, for my family, even if they don't have any discernible feelings of fondness for me, or me for them, in truth. Even though they patently don't understand, and don't want me around, but want be to become successful so that they may reap the benefits, even if those benefits are only pride. 

This is my last attempt. If I haven't found a decisive and effective way to improve upon my life in a year's time I will end it, as it is my right and has long been encroaching on being too much to bear.

I don't really expect replies. I just hope that if you read this maybe you can reflect on some aspects of it yourself and maybe they'll help you. I used to take solace in commiserating but I am disconnected as ever. Perhaps this is my attempt to feel that way again. "

Unchainedboar,5dwmcn,1479618804,I will try and explain why i consider killing myself,"My name is Adam, i am 24 i will be 25 in a month, i live with my mother atm i have moved out a bunch of times each time it has been for a job each time it has ended in a lay off with me having to move back in with my mom. This time it has been almost 2 years i have been here with no real sign of that changing anytime soon.

I am asexual, in my 24 years i have never kissed a girl, been on a date anything, girls do not get me excited, neither do men and i will say for the record i wish i was gay, if i was gay i would have hope that one day i could have a relationship, someone to care about me and me to care about but how could that ever happen with no sexual attraction.

I am a crossdresser, i only do it alone in my house but it is one of the few things that make me happy, i cant explain it but for some reason i am genuinely happy when i am crossdressing.

I have no friends minus a few online friends, i have never been able to make friends i cant explain it, weather it is just me having a horrible personality that turns people off, i seriously seriously considered killing myself during high school. I had a plan i learned how to tie a noose and i tried to build myself up to it but i decided i would stick it out because it must get better after.

But it didnt, almost 25 and i still think about suicide almost daily, the ONE, ONE thing that made it better was over a year ago now where for 2 years i had a Dog she was a German Sheperd her name was Ari, i got her at 8 weeks old and the 2 years i had her were the best years on my life she was my best friend and i loved her so much, but what happened was i got layed off and i could not find another job that could support where i lived and my only choice was to go back to my mothers and where she lived did not allow pets, so i gave her away, i made sure she went to a good home but it was the hardest thing in my life. The day i gave her away i drank an entire bottle of Rum and passed out i was so sad, for the record i never drink i think i have actually been drunk a total of 3 or 4 times in my life.

Those are some of the reasons that i consider ending my life, i think about it everyday and i can say that i shift from wanting to live to wanting to die."
compulsorymoustache,5anx65,1478059518,how do you talk when youve been silent for so long,"Ive been quite the failure the past decade. I dropped out of uni 3 years ago struggling with anxiety (never diagnosed, just visited a uni counselor once and then stopped when she left for vacation - said I was a self destructive perfectionist) when I found what I really wanted to do. It didnt fit what my parents want, ofc. 

For context...ive been told my temper is the most calm amongst my siblings. Its not true. I just hold it in most of the times because someone has to. I keep quiet. I try not to argue with my dad. Silence is better than inciting anger, even if he's already gearing up to be angry. Perhaps especially then. No, he's not abusive. 

Ive been jobless for 3 years. I'm too afraid to apply to study what I want. I'm fortunate my parents have been willing to support me so far. Recently I tried to reach out to more artists and attend some conventions as an artist, using some of my savings from freelance work/short employments. Yea, a privileged move. Dad didnt like that. Its useless, you see. You dont earn much from our cons here. What's a couple hundreds compared to a full month's employment? Its worthless. Its a waste. A disappointment.

He confronted me again this morning in the name of love, when I tried to follow him to work. If I'm lucky, I'll find someone to marry and raise my own family, he said. Interest is only for the old. Interests are worthless. I'm useless. I'm a disappointment. I'm without morals and morale. He asked me for my plans. I couldn't speak. He asked again, cradling his head tiredly and that gets to me. My throat is choked up, my face feels frozen. I still cant fucking t a l k. He accused me of being mindless, of not planning, of being cold. I wish I could laugh.

How do I even start? That I have goals and aspirations too, that I'm burning up inside so much that my skin feels too tight, that I just want to rip myself apart and maybe whatever then spills out will speak.

Maybe I'll find my voice then. Maybe then I won't be broken.

I held out. I held it in. I remained impassive and walked back to my room, locked my doors. Shivers, tears. It usually passes after an hour or two. I really wasnt thinking when I found my scissors in my hands and retreated into the shower cubicle where I could curl in and hide. I'm terrified of pain. The thought of blood petrifies me.

I got up and wrote a small note. Made sure my friend has my passwords to my email accounts (for work) and social medias by leaving a small text file in our shared dropbox. Cleared out my desk trash and clutter. Tempted to tear my art pieces up too.

My veins have always been easy to spot since I was young (a doctor once said to me, ""you have pretty veins""). It'd be easy to guess where to slice. They say the inner thigh's artery would only take a minute to bleed out. I feel like such a.... Just one minute and I'll free everyone of this cruel cycle. They'll be free then.  But I can't. I'm so terrified of pain; that moment when knife slices meat, the way it bends down and then up as it cuts through. That vision petrifies me. Would it hurt less if I'm drunk? I dont drink. Nurses used to hold me down for even a jab/blood draw.

Its been more than 12 hours now. I left the bathroom and hid under my table, trying to keep quiet as I cry and breathe. When I thought I was done with it, I tried to do some reading, but as soon as I hear a noise from outside my room, I freeze up and the tears start again. Its hard to breathe, its hard to feel anything. It feels numb but not. It feels empty like I can now fill my head up with whatever I want but I'm too tired to try. Is this how brain washing works btw? Typing all these have been the most productive I've been all day today. Ive been pounding my head against my desk, humming to myself helps, scratching the scissors against some boxes because  I'm too much of a wimp to stab it into myself. Tried looking at some comedy, laughed and then started crying, so that's a no. I've never been hysterical before. Staring at walls, laughing for no reason. It feels like I'm either going insane or I'm being a dramatic shit. Perhaps both. Probably the later. I'm perfectly self aware. It just feels good not to think and let my body do what it thinks it wants to do. Flop on the floor? Wave my hand at ceilings? Hammer my head against the wood? Rock myself? Stand and stare at nothing and laugh? K. I showered. Took my room keys with me into the shower. Imagined talking to a psychiatrist except no. I can't talk. I'm paranoid. Anyone my parents bring me to would be someone who would report back to them. Work ethics? My country isn't very high on those. I can't talk.

I dont know how to anymore.

This is the best I can do and have done, on reddit where I'm just another faceless name. Is this a bid for pity? Make myself feel better via emphatisers by demonizing my father?(he's not, really). I dont want to think anymore. I dont deserve. Everything will pass, right? This is just a phase. I feel both too keyed up to sleep, and too tired to try. I want to stop. I dont know how to. I'm going to regret this post.

I typed that yesterday. I cut myself for the first time today. I get why they call it blooming now. Its less painful than I feared. It stings but it helps me focus. Ive finally stopped crying. Gonna need to wear jeans. Looks kinda like Christmas lights. Thanks for reading."

I was so proud of you! But then you went into college, and you repeated what you did in high school. Youre a piece of shit. Why the fuck would you do that to yourself when you've promised that you would never do that ever again? Now look at you. You fucking promised. You fucking said you would better yourself but you can't. What the fuck have you done right? All you do is take shit. You're a fucking pushover. You can't even hold a job for longer than 4 months. And your co-workers didn't even like you. Even your girlfriend talks shit about you. And when you go to your best friend to talk about it, he leaves because you're a boring piece of shit. You aren't even close to your family are you? You look at your parents like they are your wallet. Fucking trash. Just end yourself. You really don't deserve anybodies attention. You're a freeloader. A person noone likes and you cant even talk right.

Tonight is when I'm really going to disconnect from everything. What am I doing. I don't feel like I belong here. I don't feel good. I feel so down.

I got refused by the guy again, and in the end made out with my ex. My ex found it really difficult to get over it, so we both tried. But later on he became quite obsessive with it and emotionally abused me. He was extremely unstable. We dated for five months and we broke up in the end because of his ptsd.

I keep a journal and talk to myself (out loud if it's been a particularly bad day). So I dove into the working world head first as soon as I got the chance. Dropped out in the 11th grade. Got my GED. Been working ever since. But now I am off my stride in the worst way. I put all my eggs in one basket so to speak and now that basket has been run over by a speeding bullet train. If anyone can learn from my mistake. Leave your social at home. NEVER carry cash if it's not what you usually do. At this point I'm just ready to end it all. I have not been diagnosed and I am not on meds but I have known depression for a lot of my life. I keep my hardships to myself cause who wants to hear about someone else's problems...I don't...Unfortunately for me though I have screwed up beyond repair this time. All I know is in the face of homelessness I choose death. I see everyday the plight of the homeless in my society. The false hope in their faces. I'm human and I make mistakes. I lost something I was supposed to keep up with. I lost it at the worst possible time. But I will not be homeless for it. I will not be pitied or shamed. I will not live an even more undignified life. Not if I don't have to. I'm glad I told my family I'm an atheist before hand. That was a big disagreement. But they loved me anyway. Before I end things I want to let them know how much I love and appreciate them. They are great loving people. And I just wanted to see them succeed. I wanted to see my kids(nieces and nephews) grow up to be amazing adults. I don't want to fight a futile fight...but for my kids I will. Even though I know in my heart of hearts how this will end. I mean it's shameful any way you dice it. At least if I had cancer or was disabled or in a coma I'd have an excuse but I'm not that lucky. Never have been. So when I go to try and replace my ID cards and they deny my applications, when my phone is cut off and I'm unable to get a job or take care of myself...I will have no regrets. As long as I know I did all I could. As long as they know I love them. I will have NO regrets or fears about what comes after."

It was consensual and I don't know what to do.,I never thought I would get to this point in my life considering how much I love life. I just can't believe this has been done and I don't know how to handle it. It's gotten to a point where it's just my word over hers and I can't handle that.

[deleted],5esddi,1480058225,I can feel myself slipping back into thinking about nothing except dying,"I'm in my early 30's. When I was in high school, I was social, active, hardworking, and relatively happy. It was also then that I was diagnosed with psoriasis. In college it crawled all over me and completely hollowed me out. I was consumed by it. I started wearing longsleeves and jeans out of season so I could hide it; people would ask me why I was wearing jeans in the Summer in the South and I'd come up with some excuse. Nobody knew. I started to have issues with dandruff and began wearing darker clothes to hide it and became constantly conscious of if anybody was standing behind me. I started to gain weight. I stopped hanging around people. I started to wish I could crawl into a hole and never come out again. I didn't want people to look at me.


My first dermatologist was shit. She gave me some cream that tore up my inner thighs. That, coupled with gaining about 20 lbs. gave me horrible stretch marks. I mean, like huge, pencil-thick lines on both of my inside thighs. I was already not swimming or wearing shorts, but that ruled things out completely. After a doctor or two later, I started phototherapy, which, if you've ever done it, is really dehumanizing. You basically strip down to a dong sock and goggles over your eyes for protection. It helped my psoriasis but would also burn my skin and increase my chances of skin cancer later down the road. I felt like a fucking science project, standing in that machine. I didn't feel human.


I've had some career issues ever since college and have had trouble finding a job that is a good fit for me and being secure financially. I even went back to grad school for a bit, but I'm finding myself in the same boat.


I turned to eating as a coping mechanism. I stopped doing anything active and was eating worse and worse food. So, not surprisingly, I continued to gain weight. I'm not overly obese like your stereotypical neckbeard or anything, but compared to how fit I was in high school, I'm ashamed of what I've become, and I hate meeting people from high school or even college now, because I can tell they notice. Because I've eaten like shit the past few years, I've developed IBS, and after three years of more doctors and more treatments, it doesn't look like there's an end in sight. Oddly enough, I eat a lot better now, but my symptoms are worse than they were when I was eating like shit.


Any sort of relationship is unimaginable. In college, maybe I could've told a girl or two that I dated, but I didn't dare it, and those relationships have ended before we got that far anyway. And I have seen and felt my social skills slip ever since. I don't even know that many women now who aren't already married or haven't already rejected me. I've tried Tinder/Bumble, but after the first date, I never hear from them.


Because I either didn't have insurance or didn't have very good insurance a few times in the past few years, I've resorted to clinical studies to afford treatment. This is where I have to let my psoriasis go untreated for months. My particular case doesn't get very red, but it spreads all over my entire body: scalp, face, ears, torso, arms, legs, even my fucking penis (once before). What the fuck. Then I can receive a study drug, which may or may not work. One time I was kicked from a study because I tested too high for depression. They made me see a psychologist, who diagnosed me with Major Depression. She helped me realize some of the trappings of my thinking, and tried to help me work with them. It worked for a while, but eventually I had to stop seeing her (money).


So here I am. The drug that *was* working for me for a few months is starting to lose its effectiveness as psoriasis creeps down from my head and up from my legs once again, in a process I've become very familiar with now. I've stopped going out almost entirely because I'm usually too exhausted from work and I'm super anxious about either someone noticing my encroaching psoriasis or my stomach acting up (I once had the worst case of diarrhea in my life on a date at a pizza place--I wanted to die). My friends have more or less stopped inviting me to things; they know what the answer will be, spoken or unspoken. I have zero romantic options right now, and even the thought of that makes me anxious. I lost some weight earlier in the Fall because my anxiety was so bad I had stopped eating, but some new medicine for my anxiety/depression and stomach (which has helped a little) makes me constantly hungry. So I've gained it all back.

**Here's your tl;dr:**

So here I am. Almost in my mid-30's. A job that is stressful and I'm questioning if it's what I want to do. No romantic prospects. Dwindling friend circles. Financial struggles. Stomach issues. Crippling anxiety/depression. And, if it's not already obvious, absolutely zero self-control or self-discipline. I'm starting to feel like I just failed at life--I let my psoriasis get to me too much when I was young, and I should just save myself however long I have left (which can't be long or, based on the way things have been going, pleasant) and everybody else the trouble and just fucking kill myself."
LadyMiriam,5e2iyv,1479707444,"My best friend ""broke up"" with me because she wanted to be with my ex. Now half of my friends don't speak to me. She is still my flatmate.","Around two month ago my bf and I broke up. After that I was totally out. I couldn't get any work done, I couldn't go out, be with friends, anything. I started to felt like I made a mistake that I couldn't take back. My best friend knew this. I told her I wanted him back that I wasn't feeling ok. I missed him.

2 weeks after that, my group of friends (including my ex and my best friend) went out for partying. At some point of the night, one of my friends (which has a girlfriend) started to try something with me. I reject him a thousand of times. Over and over. Even he tricked me and pulled me onto the boys bathroom in the club and I run out. I was very angry.

At the end of the night, I finally was totally wasted and accepted to have something with him. My mistake. He threaten me about not telling anything to his girlfriend or anyone. At the point he even said like ""I will make you regret it"". After that the situation just got worse.

The next days I discovered I was pregnant from my ex. I just couldn't eat, talk, see anybody. I was totally lost. I didn't know what to do. What to say. I was blocked.

A few days later. The ""guy of the club"" called me and told me we had to talk. He told me that he told his girlfriend that we hookup but he didn't tell her the hole story where he were trying so hard and I was avoiding him. And told me that the best way to overcome this for all of us is not talking about this to anyone ever because his girlfriend asked me to. And obviously they didn't want to see me more too.

After that, I got a little """"relief"""" about that situation, and I wanted to talk with my ex, about how sorry I was (I made a big big mistake when we were together and I think is the main reason we broke up), that I missed him, and that I was pregnant.

I started a conversation, and after a ""Hello"" he told me he didn't want to talk to me or see me again (without me telling anything). I was totally socked about it, because I didn't know what this was happening, but I wanted to respect his decision.

And then is when all the crap just exploded.
That night, my best friend of 4 years (which also is my flat mate) kissed him. I don't know how but She made everything look like it was my fault. She didn't regret it and she told me that he was more important to her that I was.

What I know now is that she told my ex lies about our relationship and she blame me for everything. Also, she told me she didn't want to be my friend anymore and that I was a bad toxic person, that I tried to manipulate her but she didn't know how or why.

She was like my sister. That night, I wanted to kill myself. My heart was broken. Sometimes I wish I did kill myself, because now sometimes I feel like I am dead already since that day.

After that, she start telling my other friends that I was a very bad person, like a devil, and nobody should continue being my friend (or something like that I was told). They told me things that she was speaking about me. Most of them were lies, but I told nobody (except my mom) about this, because to be true I though nobody will believe me.

I know this because some of my friends noticed this lies and told me about it, because at that point none of them talked to me.
Also, she confessed when she was drunk to one of my friends that she felt horrible and guilty about what she did to me. That she only was confused because she wanted to have my ex for her, but she knew that will never happen if she were my friend, so the only solution was not being my friend anymore. But to do that without losing our friends and my ex she had to blame me somehow of all that. She asked for forgiveness to a friend of mine for this and ask him not to hate her.

On top of that, she stayed all last week sleeping in his apartment, with the excuse that she didn't want to be at home, but staying all day long in the apartment, just spending the night out with him. My friend feeling was that she wanted to have an opportunity with him.

I discover that this was her intentions like 4 days ago. I had like a panic attack when I discovered. 

I just felt so betrayed, lied, manipulated, and that all this wasn't fair. This last 4 days has been totally shit. I didn't wake up from bed, almost no food or anything. I can't sleep. I can't go out. I am complete lost. I don't know how to pass this state.

I feel very angry. I feel hate. And I feel so bad for feeling hate that makes everything worse. And my mind can't stop.

Only thinking about all this makes me cry non-stop. Breaks my heart over and over. I don't know where are even the pieces. I don't know how to continue anymore.

Plus all that situation, one of the best friends of ""the guy of the club"" told me that the guy only got involved with me because he wanted to pressure her girlfriend into being an open relationship or have threesomes, and that he saw an opportunity and took it. Thinking that somehow I will convince her gf to have a 3-some with me. ???. Yeah, WTF?!

I lost the fate in humanity. I don't know how to overcome all this. I lost my group of friends. My sister. My ex.

I don't want to live anymore. I can't trust anybody. I just cry. I cry a lot. I have mixed emotions of hate and love. All the time.

I sill in love my ex. I can't even hate my ex-best friend because I still love her too. But in the other hand, a little part of me want her to suffer what I am suffering right now.

I am totally desperate. I don't want to have those bad feelings about anybody. I just don't know what to do.

Did you ever have a similar situation? How did you get over it?
Some words of advice will be helpful.

PD1. I am not longer pregnant. I lost the baby due to the stress of all this after my best friend told me she didn't want to know from me again. Nobody knows that I was pregnant anyway.

PD2. I lost my job too.

PD3. I still live with her.

PD4. Is it my impression of am I totally screwed?"

jerzeypipedreamz,5cya85,1479156380,Suicide from Chronic lifelong backpain," I've been battling chronic back pain for about 4 years now. Have had and l5 s1 fusion with a laminectomy and discectomy. Also had a titanium cage put in. Had a dura year that lead me have arachnoiditis and spinal fibrosis. This spine disease is for life. Its very painful and relentless with the only drug shown to work, being methylprednisolone. I can not take it constantly without having very serious side effects. Im on pain killers, muscle relaxers and have a spinal cord stimulator. I'm confined to my bed and the floor for stretching for most of my time and doctors say it will be like this for the rest of my life. Im 29 years old. My wife left me and took the kid. Lost my car. My career. Back at my parents place. Why go on? I've had a really awsome life up until now. No complaints what so ever. Life has been good to me. So why should I endure agonizing pain while trying to extend my life for as long as possible? With all they have to extend life and nothing to make it any better, what good is it? What good am I to anyone in this state? The doctors have done everything they can But because of the arachnoidits, they can't even give me a ESI without the high chance of totally disabling me. But I tell them I'm ready to die and it's the worst thing ever. If a dog gets injured and is suffering and slowly dying, you take it to the vet and if nothing else can be done, there's always one more option. You can put the animal down, because we don't want to see our furry friends suffer needlessly at the end of there life. So why is it any different with people? Why is it ok to suffer everyday for an unknown amount of time while we await the end and if we mention wanting to leave on our own terms we're ""not thinking clearly""? That alone is inhumane. I just want to move on so everyone else can too. So tired of living like this and dragging all my loved ones with me. Btw I am naturally a very level headed, phylisophical individual who thinks with logic. Anyone out there feel this way or have something to say on this? Opinions are warmly welcomed.

saintscrub,5ainbk,1478001735,Suicidal Daily Thoughts,"Saturday: I did it again and resolved myself to atonement.

Sunday: I panicked when the familiar signs set in and begged you to not blacklist me. You reluctantly agreed and I barely made it to the hospital on time. When I arrived, I was a blubbering mess. I was scared that contrary to what I told you, I might not be able to ""keep going;"" but they turned things around for me. There were a couple of consequences to my actions and I will never be as healthy as before, especially because the I just did the same thing a couple of days ago. I was weak after the treatment and left the next day. Before leaving, as I recuperated, regrets filled me. I should not have come here.

Monday: I wish I wasn't walking on this earth still; that's what I'm thinking in each and every waking moment. I thought that I'd be okay if we could still keep in touch. I thought if there was hope for friendship, I would be okay. But I know there isn't and I was just deluding myself; I was too scared to leave. But each waking moment is painful. I don't sleep well because of the nightmares. You broke up with me, but I still have nightmares. It's absolute misery being alive, feeling this sad. 

I'm back to finding another way to atone. I know you want to remove me from your life. I can do that. I know you will continue to make me feel even more miserable which will give me the strength I need to do it again. I want to escape this pain. 

* If you had been the slightest more loving, just even one text to show you thought of me without my prompting, that would have been enough. But you weren't. You made me feel so unloved when all I wanted was your affection. You never gave me that. When I showed you I cared, you said it was a nuisance and called me a ""neurotic mother."" I don't get that from other people when I ask them how they're doing, how their day was. Other people showed me they care for too which made me feel sad. The care I showed you was unreciprocated. 
* You took what I gave you and used that against me. I thought I was free when you threw it away. I was devastated when you said you had more and even more so when you never denied potentially using that against me again. I was distraught. 
* Now, you're doing all the things you refused to do with me and it makes me feel so sad. I did everything you wanted to; we never went any where because you were lazy. I begged you to do those things with me and you refused to. Yet, you're easily doing those with your friends. Like with your sport; I begged you for two years to do a physical activity with me. Your friend only had to ask once and when I got mad, you got mad at me. 
* You made me know you thought I was trash and made me feel like I was trash when you invited me to play with you, knowing fully well I'm not good at the game. It made me feel so sad. I played with a friend and did badly, but my friend told me, ""it's just a game, you don't have to apologize."" I cried because of the stark difference in attitude. 
* I feel so stupid for staying for you. You hated me so much, you never loved me. Even the gifts I gave you. You banned me from buying you games. When you received them, you told me you didn't want a chair or a book. I put so much thought into those gifts. I don't know what you're going to do with them. I want them back if you're not going to keep them, but you'll probably begrudge me of even that despite having offered to pay you.
* You'd rather be single than be with me. I'd rather die than be without you. I wish you were okay with that. I wouldn't feel badly otherwise. I wish I didn't care about how you feel. It's so painful. All the things you said about me being needy, difficult, and stalker like hurt me still. I was needy because you neglected me. If you had shown me an ounce of care, I would have been fine. But you never gave me the time of your day. You said I was being difficult. I was difficult in your eyes because I didn't want you to black mail me again. I was stalker like because I didn't know who she was to you, because I missed you and wanted to see you, because you didn't talk to me in five days and I didn't know what you were doing.

Tuesday: I want to die, so badly. Please, let a car hit me. Fatally, please."

yvro,5enhqi,1479989866,I'm a failure,"I'm 33 years old.
I've been feeling depressed the majority of my life. Since around high-school age I was a loner, and didn't have many meaningful interactions with people. I was always the slightly weird guy.

I failed many years of college and then dropped out. That's because I often have no motivation to do anything. I just feel like shit. I've got no formal skills.
I got a job in a family member's company, but I hardly put in any effort, I don't care enough. They tolerate me. I'm not able to get a job in anything else.

I still live at home with my parents (yes, at 33). This is because it's located in the same tiny town as my job, which is convenient.
I'm also able to save a lot of money this way. 
I have tried living alone, but I usually never left my room and starting getting lonely and anxious from the loneliness. I'm always socially anxious. I feel like people are judging me.

Most of the time, I'm generally unhappy.
I don't have any friends.
Almost every day I think about suicide. I have sometimes starting preparations and were close to doing it, but chickened out.

2 Years ago, something amazing happened. With a lot of luck on my part, I met the girl of my dreams. Stunningly beautiful, very intelligent, and the same quirkiness which I have. She accepted me as I was.
We were living in heaven. We completed each other sentences, we were as close to soul mates as you can get.
I never thought about suicide anymore. I started doing big projects in the company, I got responsibilities in other organisations. I was full of life, of motivation, of positive emotions.
I had never experienced that before. Everything was going well.
I also got to know some of her friends, which accepted me.

A couple of days ago, we broke up. We loved each other, but she has just come to the conclusion that she never wants to have children. I do want to. No further discussion was possible.
So, we broke. She doesn't want to talk to me ever again, because she thinks it's easier that way to get over me.
She deleted me on Facebook. Her friends also started being unresponsive towards me, in loyalty to her.
She was my pillar, my best friend, my sunshine.

Now I'm alone again. No friends. No joy.
I'm at the edge of despare. 
I learned that having a partner who I can trust is crucial for me.

The thing is, she was my soul mate, and extremely beatiful. I don't think I will ever be able to get anyone like her again.
Nobody else wants a college-dropout loser who lives at home.
Before her, I had some short relationships, but I never deeply connected to anyone.

I feel like my world has crumbled, that I will never be able to be happy again. Even if I could be happy for a moment, I would think about my perfect girl, and the perfect years we had together...

I've been crying for days, unable to do anything. I'm a wreck. 
There are some important and urgent work projects I had total responsibility over, which I don't care about anymore. People have been calling me, but I ignore everything. I have no energy to talk. I will probably not be able to keep my job, or the respect of the people I used to work with. I think the rest of my life will be the same. Failing from one thing to the next.
I've  been thinking about killing myself all the time."

DongDongExtreme,5c0621,1478684595,I Feel So Helpless,"Today has not been a good day. I broke down in tears much harder than I ever remember. Beyond this, my suicidal and homicidal thoughts have grown in intensity and I'm too ashamed and too fucked up to tell anyone about it. I won't see my therapist for another month at minimum and I can't talk to any of my friends about what's destroying my peace-of-mind. Who the fuck would be able to offer help to their friend who fantasizes about killing their own fucking dad? Who's filled with so much despair and misanthropic rage that they shake in public places and have to force themselves not to explode around other people? It'd be so much easier for everyone if I was fucking dead.

I know so many people say ""things get better,"" but honestly, they only get better when you make them better. Those who seek change must create it. When you're a lazy, unmotivated and introverted piece of shit, making change is like drawing blood from a stone. As much as I want things to change and after all the help I've gotten from my therapist and doctor, the only way my life will improve is if I get off my lazy ass and do something about it.

But I won't. I never do. I've always been avoidant and I never have the strength to force myself into doing things that will improve my circumstances. I can tell my parents are starting to resent me for that. Every therapy session ends with ""well, if you don't do anything about it, then don't expect things to improve."" I don't. I don't expect anything to improve. I just want to die. Every single good thing that happens always goes away. It's like the light at the end of the tunnel is always a train, and you only realize you're tied to the tracks when it's too late. I'm not sure there's anything left for me."

Haven't cut in a good while and I'm trying my most not to break that, cause I know that when I first do, I'll be close to severe damage again. But I dunno if it's a waste staying clean or not. Wanna feel alive again by almost dying, I know it's irresponsible. Problem now is I'm getting more and more happy in life, at the same time as my mental illness keeps getting worse.

warface25,5c7sv9,1478784388,[17m] I think I might kill myself,"tldr: fuck my ""life""

I'm 17 years old and in high school (grade 12) right now my grades are falling fast even though they need to be high to get in a decent college. I'm probably not gonna get into college let alone get my High School Diploma. I'm lazy, pathetic, and probably worth more dead than alive. I'm running out of reasons to keep living.

I also happen to have a pointless crush on a girl in one of my classes. Which makes me even more lonely than I already am. It's stupid because we haven't even talked to each other yet because she's on the other side of the room and I'm too introverted/socially awkward to approach her. I'm constantly dealing with self loathing because i'm cowardly and inadequate It feels like every day I consider killing myself. At school I have several projects due that I haven't even started yet. Oh and I also have a major test that I haven't studied for. Why? My own fucking laziness. I'm scared that i'll never amount to anything and I consider suicide but then I feel like a coward and i feel even worse. It's like i'm in this weird cycle of wanting to kill myself and then feeling guilty and pathetic because it would hurt my immediate family if I actually went through with it. Then again I will just be a disappointment to them if I decide to keep living. 

Someday's I have no motivation whatsoever, yet for some reason I force myself to keep going to school even though i'm just a waste of space there. My mediocre ""life"" is falling apart before my eyes. I just want my life to be over. I'm running out of reasons to live. I'll probably kill myself before the year is even over.

I wish I can just die.18 yrs is enough and it's too much.

ifeelterribleee,5f119n,1480187836,My hospital admission has made me certain I want to kill myself,"I was admitted because of my counsellor... I had to tell at least 6 different ppl what happened to me in detail. One was the receptionist... she asked me what happened and the police who escorted me told her in front of all the waiting patients. It was like a nightmare. 

I've been seen by so many different nurses and doctors who are giving me whatever pills I want... Ativan to calm me down, Tylenol for my headache, Prozac for depression and anxiety, prazasn (or whatever it's called) for my nightmares and flashbacks... 

I've been isolated in this one room for 24 hrs. I can't sleep. The ppl in the other rooms are screaming and banging their doors to get out... I'm not the same as them... I feel so fucking crazy and fucked up just being in here

I keep askin for a nurse... they tell me it's too busy and they're understaffed.... I'm freaking out and hyperventilating and I feel like they don't care....

They didn't even record what I said correctly... I never said I'd kill myself this weekend... NEVER. but that's what they put. 

I still hear the ppl in the rooms screaming and banging on the doors and it's giving me so much anxiety. I don't want to be alone in this room and I can't listen to the ppl go crazy

Even the guards watching told me I shouldn't have been in here for so long... it's just too overcrowded 

I feel like no one is listening to me... I'm not talking anything out with anyone... just telling my story over and over and over and over and over again, I have to keep reliving it... I'm being treated like I'm crazy

If this is what help is like I don't want it at all. I'm not going to go back to therapy after this. I'm just going to kill myself. This isn't help 

I can't leave until the doctors think I'm safe... I can't stop panicking.... someone plz keep me company or help me "
xAMDead,5euqr8,1480095674,I'm going to kill myself today,"I don't know why I thought this would be a good idea, but fuck it, here it goes. 

I work retail, I always have, but this is the first holiday I've worked in nearly 5 years where I'm not a manager, and I feel completely useless all of a sudden. I've been battling depression since I was 16 (23 now) and I just don't want to deal with it anymore. I was at work last night until 3am, never fell asleep, so maybe it's just my insomnia talking, but this isn't a life worth living. I hate myself, I hate that I'm overweight, I hate that I have no friend anymore, I hate that even though life is going well right now and I'm making more than I've ever made, I feel more empty now than I ever have before. 

I don't want this to become a ""hey, don't do that"" thread, I guess it's more so for who ever goes through my phone, so that they know why I decided to do this. 

Anyway, I hope you guys have a happy holiday, I'm glad that I won't have to deal with it again "
Edvonneh,5bw3t7,1478640765,Actually I decided to give up.,"I wanted to get help I really did. But what good would that do when everything surrounding me is faulty and I can't leave. My own mother told me I am insane cause I'm not getting any dick. What the fuck woman...? She called me lazy and told me I act the way I do out of convenience. They all tell me I do this cause it is easier. Yes people yes, I am depressed and suicidal because I don't want to study???? What the fuck. Maybe it has something to do with the fact I was being and still am beaten and mentally abused talked down to, summoned like a dog, called a dog called fat ugly worthless disgusting stupid. Being told I'll never get anywhere in life, that I have nothing to offer and you guys trust me that doesn't hurt because I know I am smart and I know I care about studies and science and I have so many interests and I know I am nice and kind and I want to help, I mean my personality type is the mediator so you get the idea what I'm like but I can't control that rage and I am so angry that I am dismissed as lazy and dumb when I know I am not. I know my worth but it isn't enough to keep me going because people just can't see it. I mean my family is so fucked up. And I am not crazy cause I am not getting fucked for crying out loud how evil and medieval someone has to be to assume that (my mom is in mid 50s tho) and her mother also has those past century ideas and I don't care but I can't believe that they see me as the complete opposite of who I am. Actually I don't think anyone cared to see me the way I am for real, ever. I was never the popular kid but no one ever bullied me more than the next kid. I am aware of who I am and I know my values and abilities and it is saddening that my own family thinks I'm a lazy nobody who uses domestic abuse to justify not studying. I mean who has such a sad life? "

Snoixalicious,5cts4s,1479092497,Anyone Have Any Advice?,"Hello, my name is Cassandra.

For the past couple of years I've had suicidal thoughts. I've told people, but they either didn't know how to help in the slightest, or got angry at me.

I've been fighting this battle alone and recently I began to think of waving the white flag and giving in.

I know people would miss me. People love me. But my future isn't bright anyways.

Usually, when I couldn't stop thinking about suicide I'd consult my best friend, she'd always help, but now I feel like I can't even go to her. We had plans to be friends forever.

I don't know what to do anymore and I come here seeking some advice of how to deal with this or just some consolation.

andizzl,5dq9sy,1479520792,Depression,"Good day! I'm new to this site but whenever I'm feeling down I always search for something like ""I'm tired of my life."" ""No friends and social life."" ... so on... and luckily I found random sites including this where people around the world communicate with each other by answering someone's question and having deep conversations that's why I decided to make one! :--) Please bear with my grammar while reading this. I'm not good in english. If only I could type in tagalog words (filipino) why not? But I can't! nobody will ever understand what I'm talking about. :-) So yeah, Hi! I'm Andrea, 16 and unlike all the other teenagers out there, I don't have facebook &amp; twitter, deleted my snapchat as well.. (But I do have instagram cos that's where me and my mom talk) I don't know what's going on with me?? Seriously, I'm not an introvert person at all... In fact I USED to have a lot of friends when I was in high school but now, they're all gone... Of course I can't blame them because I'm the first one who stopped associating with all of them... I also don't want to blame myself for what I did because most of them are taking me for granted, talking behind my back, secretly hates me and I realized that they are not good for me.. Here's a confession for y'all to understand.. I was in 8th grade (14y/o to be exact) when I started partying in different clubs.. I get to know a lot of people in there, (specifically older than me) hang out with them, and even started bad habits like smoking, not attending my class, and so much more... and then the day came!! my parents found out all my bullshits in life.. I stopped studying for a year, they even sent me to a counseling prgram (almost sent me to a psychiatrist) and I'm grounded until I make good desicions in life.... (year after) Imagine guys, I was grounded for almost 2 years but really, I've no complains at all because there's nothing I can do about it.. realizing things helped me to become a better person. Takes time but it is always worth the wait. Now that I'm already in college (i took like an acceleration exam back in the days when i was grounded, reviewed, and luckily passed) :-) I am now homeschool-ed. Taking my courses online.. I didn't go for a regular school because going outside the house is not my thing anymore probably because of what happened to me year/s ago. (T'was my choice though, I'm comfortable with this) I'm happy with my life, tbh my relationship with my family became stronger but these past few days? months? I started overthinking, crying with no reason... I feel depressed. Feel alone... Sometime I'm thinking of commiting suicide cos im tired of my life, i don't think I can live my life to the fullest the way I wanted it to be. Ps:
I deactivated all my social accounts because I don't feel like people need me. People will not approach me unless I approach them.. What is wrong??? I'm a nice person. Someone that you can always count on. Easy to get along with and I am sweet!!! But seems like nobody's interested in me?? Nobody in this world is taking me seriously... "
classictom,5d65sq,1479255902,What do you do when you have no more support system?,"I've been living with my mom (I'm 25F) since I had to move home (major depressive episode), and since then she's really been my only support. I'm at a place where I can't really leave my bedroom, and I'm in no place to be able to work or afford to go back to school.

Recently, my very different kind psychiatrically ill brother has been calling up my mom at odd hours of the night, going off on long, delusional rants and including threats to hurt her. So she's been really stressed and caught up in all that mess, so I'm basically out of her radar.

What do I do now? I have virtually no one to talk to or help me in my recovery, and on top of that, I just lost my psychiatrist because he came on to me and I quit seeing him. So my meds are about to run out as of Sunday.

I sort of am giving up and just want to die, otherwise I'm just going to have to stick with this daily pain for an indeterminate amount of time, and I don't know if I have enough strength to do that. 

Should I go to a hospital? I know they don't keep you very long, but at least I would get some attention for a bit. Can anyone shed some light?"

I have been thinking of killing myself for at least half the year because of school and friends and whatever. I haven't really acted on these thoughts because there is little privacy and id probably get caught. Now that im in high school though there is a train I can jump in front of it it comes to that. However, that would probably be painful. I've fantacized about 'robbing' a gas station or something then having a cop shoot me but i am a coward. So let's talk about the school part: 
I've recently entered high school and its frankly stressful. THe teachers are in my opinion are worse (I really miss my 8th grade teachers) so in combination with that and my lack of interest my grades have suffered. Honestly, I shouldn't be bothered because there are still the weighting to be considered and I am doing well by anyone but my standards. For first month or two, my IT and Engineering classes were the reason that I attended school in the first place but those are starting to lose my interest. last year I stoppped caring around February but this year is has been late October. It's really awkward I guess because my friends and classmates can talk to my teachers and I sit there in silence. Social interaction is very stressful. As a result, my class participation grades are my biggest downfall. In math (my first period class), I got a 9/10 for participation but I feel drained at the end of it so later in the day I get lower grades. I also don't get a lot of sleep because I watch anime and read fan fiction to try and forget about my life and be someone else for a change. (Kaichou wa Maid sama 10/10). I daydream about being Takumi Usui in that anime because that dude is a fuckin g. there is a girl I have a sort of crush on(?) She went to the same middle school as me and the same 8th grade class. Also, pretty much the only pretty school in the grade so everyone is trying to get with her. I don't really know her personality so I try to convince myself its just the pee-pee talking to make myself feel better. In my daydreams I imagine myself as the guy from that anime because he could get it. Its nice for that moment at least. I started drinking a lot of soda but I started going to the gym (i only really play basketball there though) so it evens out i guess but i blow through money really quick. Material things help me feel better until I start going through buyers remorse. For example, this summer my parents bought me parts for a pc for getting into the good school on the island but I didn't really use it for anything becuase of the vacation that took a month of the summer. (It sucked, first world problems amirite?) So I bought an r9 390 which costs $280ish to play games but I find myself only playing overwatch and civ which are pretty light. I feel like I should've downgraded so I could have a better monitor setup. the current single 24 inch monitor isn't really cutting it. ALso, I put $60 in my steam account for no mans sky but didn't end up buying (thank god). Now it just sits there. going to start a new paragraph to avoid the wall of text
So lets talk about the friends now. There are a couple of us that walk to the train together. Aside from that, we don't meet out of school. I partly blame myself for it becuase I don't even like going but I don't receive any invitations either. I have like 5 phone numbers. This gives me a lot of time to think.
Now lets do religion. I think of myself as an atheist but my family is catholic. I haven't told them but I have hinted it and still have to go to church every week. Its a really boring hour and when I have time to think, I usually start to cry. It hasn't gotten bad yet but I don't want to see it happen eventually. 
So what do you guys think? I probably didn't talk about everything that I wanted so I might be back (maybe not?) to go over the other stuff. This has not been proofread. 
Thanks fam"
Mizucchinni,5aojwb,1478070225,Sad and alone.,"I seem to fuck everything up no matter what I do. After my most recent suicide attempt (which clearly failed) I tried to get better. I did a ""Thirty day happiness challenge"" that someone told me helped them. I wrote something every day to make me happy. And it's all gone to shit.
My girlfriend of 9 months, Skylar recently snapped at me and has managed to get every single one of my so called friends to suddenly avoid me and encourage me to commit suicide. They say things like ""Stop getting in the way Mizuki! It'd be so much better if you just killed yourself"" - Jack. ""No matter how hard you try, the only thing you'll accomplish in life is suicide. How about you go try that?"" - Alice ""Why the FUCK do you think You're a human?!?! You and everyone like you should just die (referring to my being transgender). Go. Take your pills and don't stop until you die. It'd be better that way."" I'm constantly thinking about it, to the point where I called in sick to work today, planning on suicide, and I'd have done it right then and there, except I misplaced my pills. I'm contemplating it still, but I just don't feel like I have reasons to live.
I feel like all of the things I've tried to stay happy, to stay alive just won't work, that it will never work because I'm screwed up or something. I'm not right. I'm not valid. All of this is just weighing on me... The only problem is I remember last time, and I'm so fucking scared of death. I'm a suicidal coward... It's like if a car were heading straight towards me, I'd just stand there and let it hit me... I've stopped caring.
So, this is everything I have to say. My job is going to shit. My life is going to shit. I don't think I have a reason to live anymore."

I am sorry, people. But is there any other way to end my pain? My suffering? Death seems to be the only one. Death would put me at ease. Would save me from suffering. It would be peaceful. Why can't I do that? Life is not getting better anyway.

thebellme,5ahpo5,1477982722,My Story.,"Everyday I have suicidal thoughts. My first suicide attempt was when I was 14. I had been suffering with the fact I'm gay and thought that it would be easier to end my life than disappoint my family. I grew up in a pretty Christian family. I have two uncles who are pastors. I had already been cutting myself for quite sometime when I decided to swallow some antidepressants my mom would get but not take. Luckily I didn't take enough to cause any damage. I do remember my older sister talking to me and trying to calm me down though. She didn't know I had taken any pills or that I planned on slitting my wrists. She just saw I was upset. It's funny she now won't speak to me because I'm gay. I think I was 16 the next time I seriously thought about ending my life. I remember tears streaming down my face with the razor blade in hand. I can't remember what stopped me though. I didn't come out to my family until I was 19 but my mom and dad were actually pretty accepting. I started my first serious relationship a couple months later. I moved in with him pretty quickly. I experienced a lot of stress during the relationship has I never felt good enough and was always acting jealous because I knew he would leave me for someone else. I quickly realized we didn't work but it was to easy to stay and hard to leave. I would cry myself to sleep at times and he had no idea why. Right before we broke up, he suggested a triad. I went along for a couple of days. The night before we broke up, we had a huge fight and I made another attempt on my life by swallowing some over the counter sleeping pills. I woke up with a horrible headache and really groggy the next day. I made a few more attempts that week and finally realized I needed to get help. I spent a week in an inpatient psychiatric clinic. I tried to sign myself out after two days but the primary psychiatrist didn't allow it and threatened to take me to court for long term evaluation if I didn't comply. I complied because all I wanted was to get out. A couple months after I got out, I totaled my vehicle by driving it straight into a tree. I walked away with minor bruising and lied to everyone saying an animal ran in front of me so I swerved. I felt so alone. Sometimes I still feel that alone. I've not made any attempts since then. Someone once told me, think about how your mom would feel getting a call that you were gone. That's what keeps me alive despite the reoccurring thoughts of ending my life. 
I hate looking in the mirror because I am never comfortable with my body. I lost 100lbs and hated myself. I've gained 60 back and hate myself. I've been asked out on numerous dates and talked to some pretty amazing guys but always decline them or ghost them because I don't know how any of them could ever love me. I've been single for over four years now. I look for validation in Grindr hookups or trading dick picks. I have had four jobs this year. Not because I wasn't good at any of them but the opposite. I have a natural ability to excel at anything I do. I'm very friendly and tend to get along with everyone I meet. I've got great friends but only one who has lasted over the years simply because she hasn't been scared away yet. I tend to run people off and run away from situations. I read too much into stuff and end up ruining perfectly good friendships. Anytime that something in my life is going good, I find away to sabotage it. I don't believe I deserve anything good. I've quit more jobs over bullshit than I care to count not to mention the number of roommates I've ran out on due to the same bull shit. I've managed to withdraw consistently from college and actually can't receive financial aid at three colleges because of that. There are days I don't want to even get out of bed. There are actually days where I do nothing but sleep because I have no motivation to even get dressed. I think about ending my life almost daily but I have managed to control that inner voice telling me I should just put an end to it. My only escape is music and my dreams. I know if I end my life, I will bring a lot of pain to a lot of people in my life. I hope to one day be able to save a life just from telling someone else they aren't alone. I've been there. I'm currently there. I have never shared all this with anyone. I hide behind a smiling face and friendly personality just like the majority of those suffering. I hate the thought of sharing my feelings and having someone feel sorry for me or inconveniencing them. But if discussing how I feel can save one person from making the worst mistake they could ever make. It is worth it. "
FalmerbloodElixir,5dz8xf,1479665402,I'm pretty much done.,"I've struggled with depression and anxiety for years now (I was taking medication, Sertraline 50mg, for two years but it didn't seem to be doing anything so I quit in September. Probably a mistake), and I've been suicidal often. But this is the first time in a long time where I feel completely hopeless. I'm tired. Every day is stressful, even weekends because all I can think about is how much my life fucking sucks. I'm not getting good enough grades to get into university, and if I can't go to uni them I'm stuck in this rural shit-town filled with judgmental hicks (who only ever talk about farming and trucks). Even if I did get out of this shitty town, I would never get a decent job, let alone a job that doesn't make me want to kill myself even more. I worked at a fast food place for a month and a half before I quit because I couldn't handle the stress.

My daily life basically consists of skipping classes, and sitting in my room playing video games getting high. This was semi-enjoyable for a while, but after doing that all summer and most of the first month or two of school it's kind of lost its magic. But it's all there is to do. I've grown distant from the few friends I'd managed to make, and we barely ever hang out or talk anymore. I guess I should've seen it coming; all we really have in common is that we like weed. They've either gone off to college themselves, stopped smoking or just don't like to hang out with me anymore. I can see why. Over the last year or so I've become more and more of a bitter, distant asshole. It doesn't help much that I have a very bad temper, and I get set off by just about anything. It *really* doesn't help that people pick on me at school, either. Because then I get mad, and it scares me; I'm afraid I'm going to kill someone. I want to. I want to make these bullies, these wastes of oxygen, suffer like they've made me suffer.

I feel like no matter what I do I'm just going to end up back in this place again: hopeless, lonely, and wanting to die. And at some point I'm going to do it. I'm already so close. It's just a matter of my life being a tiny bit more awful. Which I know it will be, regardless of what I do - I'm going to have to be an adult now, and I don't have the first idea of how to do that.

I try doing something else to take my mind off of it, and the thoughts just slowly creep back in.

I don't want to feel like this anymore. I don't know if I'm going to do it today, tomorrow, next week, next month... I just know I'm going to do it. I am going to kill myself. It's just a matter of being sufficiently motivated to do it."

I don’t plan on committing suicide tonight, but one day I will.  I’ve been depressed for 8 years which is a third of my life and all of my adult life.

I’ll never understand why some people are challenged in life more than others, why some people can live long happy lives while others suffer every waking moment.

I’ll willingly admit there are people out there who have it far worse than I do, but I am at a constant struggle to find a good reason to continue on.  Saying I can't be depressed because someone out there has it worse than me is like saying I can't be happy because someone out there has it better than me.

Never in a million years would I have expected my life to turn out this way, to feel so terrible for such a long time.

I just want to say to everyone out there struggling with depression, I’m sorry.  I know your pain and I wish everyone could be happy.

I can’t wait for this to be over..


(I wrote this about a year ago on another suicide forum. These words resonate louder and louder everyday, despite the many changes I've made with my life I am more miserable then ever.  I think i'm at a point now psychologically where even if I miraculously became happy, I would not be able to enjoy it, I just don't feel at all anymore. Tai Lopez once described people who are depressed as people having ""scared up brains"" I think that represents me pretty well.  I'm not ashamed I don't want to live anymore and haven't for a while, I'm not ashamed that I am too weak to keep fighting.  I've lost.)  "

There's nothing more I could ever ask from the people who have unconditionally loved me and always been there for me when I needed them the most. I'm never going to forget the time at the world-championships — when it felt like the entire universe was stacked against me — it was your undying faith in my abilities that kept me going. To date, I have no idea how I still managed to make world youth champion, but I do know that it would've been a distant dream were it not for you. I will be forever indebted to you for being my perennial source of strength, my brightest candles.

I am where I am today solely because of my mistakes. Were it not for a slew of errors in judgment compounded by *sheer incompetence*, I wouldn't be caught up in this byzantine tangle of a mess. But what's done is done; I have to bear the brunt of the biggest, most miscalculated, most overblown blunder of my life.

And I see only one recourse out of this mess. Over the past weeks, I've grown cynical enough of my abilities, and despondent enough of life, to question the purpose of my existence.

I'm sorry.

Goodbye, mom and dad.

Send my love to Adam.

EDIT: I backed out. I was literally on the edge of the terrace, determined (or so I thought) to put an end to my misery, to be done with the seemingly hopeless mess I put myself in, to finally free myself from the clutches of self-loathing.

But I couldn't do it. A flood of memories hit me as I looked down. I won't go into the details, but when you're reminded of everything your family has done for you -- the times they brightened your day, the moments when you learned something cool from them, the hours they ALWAYS sat next to you when you felt upset -- you become utterly paralyzed. Paralysis slowly leads to self-discovery, which leads to a gush of tears, because you suddenly think: ""How could I possibly be doing this to them?""

I walked back.

It was painful. I might have irreparably messed up my life, but I can't do this. I can't bring a wave of undeserved sadness upon them; they're everything I have to live for.

I daydream about it, especially when I'm at work, but when I get home I just sit on the computer and kill time until I go to sleep and repeat this mundane process all over again.

There's nothing to live for for me. I'm absolutely *sick* of people telling my that I have my ""whole life ahead of"" me. It's ridiculous to think that after 22 years of being perpetually alone and miserable the next 48-68 will be any fucking different.

suchacapricorn,5d5hms,1479248415,Life is Funny,"It's funny. Just when life seems to be getting better, everything always just comes crashing down. Or maybe I was just being too optimistic. 

I'm a 22-year-old Asian American female, 5th year in university. I was academically dismissed at the end of my junior year because I have been an academic failure from the day I set foot on this campus. During my gap year I was the happiest I have ever been. I finally had time to figure things out for me and to find motivation. I took community college classes and managed to get high enough grades to get back into my 4-year college. This is my first semester back and it has been absolute hell. Academically I'm still struggling, but I'm struggling even harder just to find enough motivation to get out of bed every day and go to class which is where I feel my academic struggles are coming from. I always feel sad, or angry, or quite frankly just dead.

Things got even better today because this spring is supposed to be my last semester but now I probably won't even be graduating. I found out I won't have a way to pay for school next semester and I already owe my school money from this semester. It sucks even worse when I have already started my grad school applications and now I have to put those on hold for at least another year. I see my friends graduating and moving on with their lives and I'm still stuck in the same place I've been in for the past 4 years and I can't shake the feeling that I've failed when I know I really haven't. 

I'm super iffy about asking for or receiving professional help which is even funnier because I study rehabilitation and counselor ed and intern with a mental healthcare resource at my school. I'm just a huge hypocrite who can't take my own advice. I guess it's also because I still don't know what I want. Most of the time I don't even know why I feel the way I do. I know my life honestly isn't the worst but I also know that the feelings I have are valid. There is so much good in my life but for the past several years I have just had a hard time seeing beyond all of the bad. I don't want to kill myself, but I do want to die. Or I guess at this point I'm still unsure. This is not the first time I have had suicidal ideations but they are becoming more frequent and more concrete to the point that I actually have plans of what I would do. I'm scared to die, but I am equally scared to live with myself because all my fears and worries and demons seem to get more powerful every day. Death only seems reassuring because at this point I am not really living and the future just looks bleak. I just go through the motions. Wake up, go to school, go to work. Some days I don't even eat or sleep because my mind just runs full of terrible thoughts and they keep me awake. 

I told my best friend goodbye today. Realizing how sad and afraid that made him made me really think other people are the only thing keeping me here. I don't want to hurt the people who care about me so I keep telling myself, ""Just one more day,"" but at this point it is really more for them than it is for me. I know there are people who do care about me and want me to win this battle but it's hard to keep fighting for myself. 

Sorry that this is such a long post and it kind of went nowhere, but I just have so much in my head to sort out. Thank you for taking the time to read this and to care, because it means a lot even if you all are just strangers on the internet."
sw306e3,5dn9ms,1479486272,"I failed, now there's no going back","I am an university student on a scholarship. The way this scholarship works is, if you fail a class you lose all financial benefits + you have to pay back every benefit you've been given.  
  
Last semester I got really ill and had to be operated. I was out of class for three weeks and when I came back I felt completely lost. I had a class I thought I'd pass but when the finals came I completely failed. Shortly after the grades were posted, I was called in to the office and told my case would go to an academic committee who would decide if I kept the scholarship or not. I saved myself by handing in my medical papers. That was strike one.  
  
This semester is almost over and I just got the results of one of my classes. I needed a 50% on the final to pass the class... I scored 36%. With this surely my scholarship will get annuled.

Donkey_Blade,5dfukb,1479390161,I feel toxic.,"I have had depression, anxiety and panic attacks since I was 17. When I'm my normal self, I'm kind, I try to make people laugh, I care, I'm interesting. I'm great at socializing and communicating. Then I panic, sometimes it's alcohol or drug induced. I become a completely different person, I can be abusive and nosy, go through peoples phones, get paranoid. 

A common element to suicidal people is that they feel like they have been wronged by the world, but I just feel that I'm always the one to fuck things up for people. My ex would often tell me that I ruined trips by getting panic attacks and harassing her while drunk. Every time I talk about my feelings to people, they initially show great support, but in the end they always get drained of their energy and they need to leave. People often block me for this. This is the biggest source of panic for me, when someone informs me that they're going to block me, I go fucking insane. I try to will myself into suicide then and there but it never works.

I can't convince myself I'm a victim of anything but my own selfish, toxic, unhinged, moronic actions that drive people away and make me look like a reprehensible piece of shit, and I want to leave my city, find somewhere quiet and die. I've made a plan to leave quite soon, inform only my family, find somewhere, get so drunk that I can't turn back and then jump off of something tall or go in front of a train, something I can't back out of.

I just know that I don't want to continue like this. I meet people all day, every day, for years...

Up until this point, I've been young, there have been possibilities... But not now. If this continues for another 10 years, like it already has, I'll be 40.

myfaceinthesink,5feivv,1480369816,Help?,"I am reaching out to this subreddit since I have nobody else. That, by the way, is not a stupid self-pity statement - due to my social anxiety, I lost everyone. Literally.

Okay, let me give you guys a short summary.

I've always been a shy kid. When puberty hit, it made me feel very anxious around being strangers and even friends. I started to avoid social situations. Soon, I went from a group of friends to no friends at all. And you know what? I loved it.

It gets worse. I got more and more isolated due to my social anxiety. I started to stay at home while I should have been at school. When I even thought about seeing someone (including my friends), I would completly shut down and have panic attacks. Sweating, feeling like suffocating, shaking, crying. From one day, it got to a couple days in a row and then weeks without visiting school. Of course, the school didn't accept that - and neither did my mom. Letters came. People came. A judge came.

Wait, what? A judge. Yes. After I stayed inside (not even leaving the house anymore at this point) for a few months, the door to my room got busted open by police and I was sent to a locked mental hospital. I was 13 years old at that point.

And I thought school was making me anxious. Having no room for myself, not being able to hide from others made me go crazy. I actually tried breaking the windows, because I couldn't handle it.
After aggression came trauma. I don't really remember this phase. People told me I sat on ""my"" bed for days not saying anything - I shut down.

After 2 months in there, I was free again after I said I would go to school just fine again. Of course, nothing would be fine. The next morning when I didn't go and my mum called the judge, I ran. I packed a bag and went into the woods. That's the first time I tried to kill myself. I cut my wrists while ran was pouring down on me. I just wanted to go back to whereever I was before I was born.
I woke up in the hospital, stiched up. Fuck.

Back to the mental hospital it goes. They pumped me full of benzodiazepines. They helped, but I didn't feel human anymore, I was just numb.

Man, this is getting long. I am not that interesting, let's skip to my current self.

I am now 17 years old, very soon to turn 18. Since I was 14, I never visited school again, went to the mental hospital two more times, became addicted to benzodiazepines and finally became numb and depressed. No further suicide attemps, though.

Recently, the days have been feeling like years. Haven't talked to anyone besides my depressed, lonely mom, who works all day, in about a year. No, not even virtual friends. I deleted WhatsApp and every other social app. I couldn't even find new friends now.
I am still not leaving the house. Never will. I am just slowly dying.

The worst thing is thinking about the few happy days I used to have. I never had a girlfriend, only a crush. Only a memory, she is long gone, never even talked to her. But still, I vividly remember every situation she was involved in. I don't have much else.

I will commit suicide soon. Or maybe hang in the a couple more months, but for what? More crying about past events and events that never happend? Thinking about what a kiss would feel like?

My decision is long made. I just wanted to share my story, maybe chat a bit for the last moments, I don't know why I post this, even.

Back into the shadows I came from before I was born I go, life isn't for me, peace.

Edit: I tried therapy willingly the 3rd time I got sent to a ""prison hospital"", for 4 months. They said, quote, ""We tried every therapy form for your situation, I don't know what to do anymore. You're free to go."""

I felt as if I was getting blamed for feeling depressed or something. Like it was an option; something to just get over. That night I decided I wanted to kill myself. I popped open a bottle of sleeping pills, took around 30 and hoped for the worse. I knew it would kick in eventually. During that time, I tied these really thick shoe laces around my neck really hard. I couldn't breathe and my face was going to explode, I knew my natural instinct would kick in and force me to remove it, but I tied it hard. Over that, I found this medical/arm wrap which I tied even harder on my neck, to the point of no breathing. Slowly I could begin seeing myself knock out. I was blacking out, and I knew if I had let myself go, that I would have died cause I wouldn't have been able to breath. At that point, I came that close to dying, I felt as if I had no time left to remove the shit I wrapped around my neck. I felt as if I had just skipped death.

Siehevordir,5e6bu7,1479760234,Bad Feeling,"Hi i am 20 years old,
I think i am one of the guys, where if you see them or know them, you dont really think that he could be depressed.
I live in Vienna, Austria, and my parents are quite wealthy. I am also quiet good looking and come along good with friends and girls, so I wasnt ""lonley"" since i was 15 for more than a month or two.

Two months ago, I moved out with two good friends of mine to live closer to university and also to get more of an adult live.
In the time I moved, I left my girlfriend of two years, because I thought I needed more space and felt the need to meet new persons.
Now after two months of breakup I still cant stop thinking of her, normally I am pretty good at breakups. I wrote her a letter in which I apologised for my behaviour and if we could meet for a talk.
She replied to me, that she also had these thoughts but locked them away two months ago after the breakup and doesnt want to meet me anymore but as a friend.
Dont get me wrong, I am not a sissy and cry about my lost girlfriend as if it is the worst thing in life, i just think it is the dripping point (can you say that in english ?).

I am also a big lifting fan and thought that I dont want to live anymore 1 year ago when my shoulder broke down, it healed quite well but two days ago, it teared again while driving kart which makes me feel hopeless to regain full health again. Therefore I cant compete in tournaments anymore which is my real passion.

I just feel so lonely, even though I have a lot of ""friends"", from which at least a few really really are. still I cant talk with them about my feelings and dont think that that would change anything.

When I was 14, I started cutting my arms and when my dad found out he told me to stop this shit, but I couldnt. Whenever I dealt someone wrong or thought i was doing so, I felt the urge to penalize myself for it.
Back then I started to thought about jumping off a bridge or whatever but thought that was only a phase, but it never stopped. Of course there are months where it is better but after all, there just needs to be a tiny thing going wrong and I am completely on the thought of killing myself again.

The last few days, everytime a train was moving past, I thought of jumpin in front but obviously never did, since you couldnt read this otherwise. I wouldnt do it that way, because I dont want to ruin the drivers life. I thought about jumping but I dont think I would have the balls and I dont have a weapon to shoot and dont think that would be the way to do it since I dont want someone to have to see me with wounds.

I dont know if these are normal thoughts that go through everyone from time to time but I dont think so anymore.."
